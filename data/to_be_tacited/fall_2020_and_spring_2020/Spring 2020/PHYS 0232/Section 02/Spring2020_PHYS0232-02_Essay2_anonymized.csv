2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,457,"What resources do I have?Th resources that I have on campus are my workplace, my friends, my advisors, Metro, EOP and my scholarship program. The resource that I rely more on is my workplace because I am a student assistant of an amazing advisor from the Metro program (which I also belong to) and she is always encouraging me, giving me advise about school and life in general, so I really appreciate her support and having her and Metro as a resource.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,465,"There are many resources here at San Francisco State University. I mainly use the library, the food court, the gymnasium, and the Cesar Chavez Center. The library is a great place to get homework done as well as some studying. The food court is used for purchasing and consuming sustenance. I take advantage of the Masouf  Wellness Center when I can because it is also a resource that I use. At home I do not always need to be at the school’s library to get work done, There have been many cases where doing work at home without the resources from the school is just a viable and effective. As part of a generation that has the ability to access an entire world of endless information from the pocket of our jeans, it’s homework is doable anywhere in the world."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,471,i have many resources being a college student at sf state. the biggest resource i see myself using is the supplemental classes for math and science classes. the school offers this resource because they realize that these classes are hard to teach and understand over a single semester; this class gives us an opportunity to seek out extra help in order to pass these difficult classes. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,456,"In order to go to school, VA pays my tuition and rent which helps quite a bit. We have Sci classes that act as supplemental classes on top of regular class which help us understand the lecture material pretty well and ask questions. Library is open most of the hours and there is 24hr section which helps a lot for studying at nights. There are laptops and other equipment we can borrow for doing school work. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,458,"What resources do I have?  At this point, I've realized that I have many resources to help me with my scholastic responsibilities. Majority of them are found online and are done online. Video sources provided by professors are viewed via youtube, Zoom conferences are held on a weekly basis."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,455,"One of the resources I have are those that help with food programs. There are groceries programs and food stamps programs available in case I would feel the need to use them. SFSU also has a program that temporarily assists students that do not currently have a place to sleep or live in by allowing them to stay in a dorm for a limited time. I also have family and friends as well as my church members to help guide me in more personal, deep, and/or spiritual challenges that I am facing. I have teachers and tutoring centers to assist me in my school work. I have the Veterans Administration that is there to help me with health insurance and school payments as well as providing other resources that are beneficial for veterans. I have the internet to help push me in the right direction in almost any questions that I may have. Foremost, on a spiritual level I have God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit to assist me in anything. I also have myself, I know myself best and have the right ideas most of the time, I just have to act on them. Also, hi."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,470,I am extremely lucky that I have a great resource which is the VA Program. They have help guide me and finance my schooling. They also have educational tips and a lounge are where I can interact with others that are going through the same process. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,472,So far I don’t know much about Gauss’s Law besides the formula and some basic material we covered in lecture. I know that it has to do with electric flux and the distruibution of electric charge in a electric field. It also involves coloumb’s law. But basically I know that Gauss’s law states that in a closed surface area the electric flux is equal to the total charge inside the area.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,461,I feel like the resources I have for this class are actually way better than when I took physics one w cal one. I have my textbook which isn’t that hard to read and it seems like the physics department has made it really accessible for students to seek tutoring from different professors. Also the sci classes are helpful. In terms of resources for my life I have friends who support me and a family who cares about me and a few teachers who actually do care about my wellbeing and studies
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,473,"The resources that I have available to me I am very thankful for. For 2 years now I have been going to the pantry that is offered here at state. When the program first started, I noticed that not a lot of people went to the pantry. Now after two years, if I’m not at least 30 mins early I am forced to wait in a line that will probably take me 45 mins. I’m very grateful for the pantry on campus. I haven’t had to buy bread or peanut butter for a long time now."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,462,"Resources. I am fortunate to have a lot of resources available to help me in life. I was in the military, so my tuition is covered and I get a monthly stipend for housing. When I was younger, I had a very knowledgeable friend who taught me how to make wise choices with money, so I have enough money saved and invested to feel stable in life, even if something unexpected happens. This money I saved over a decade of working is an invaluable resource at this point in my life. My family and friends are an emotional resource that gives my life meaning and enjoyment. My parents are always available to talk to me and encourage me, and I love visiting them during the holidays."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,211,"I think that I have a good amount resources in my life; especially for school. The main resource I take advantage of is the library. The library is my main resource besides the gym because it allows myself to have a nice quiet area where I can prioritize my classes and focus on what’s in front of me at the time. I think that the gym is another huge resource of mine because it allows myself to get away from school, work, and family life. This also allows myself to relax completely while also staying healthy. I think that I don’t really have a good learning center on campus or maybe I just don’t know about it. I think that I would prefer a learning center on the basement floor of the library with many accessible tutors especially in Math, Science, and English. Another resource I have is free public transportation. This one is huge for myself because I have been born and raised in San Francisco and I know how to use public transportation throughout the whole city. This allows myself to never have a reason to miss school unless I am sick or have a family emergency. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,464,The resource I would say I have and am greatful for would be the funding for my college education from my parents as without it I would have to be working twice as harder and all I need to do now is study.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,450,resources I have as a student in school are library where I study and do homework in the breaks I get between classes. I have a full time job so I don't get time to prepare meals at home so the cafeteria is a good resource to get my meals when I'm at school. group members in classes help with class activities. lecturers are available during office hours is  a good resource if I get stuck with any problems. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,203,I have the professors for office hours and I have the internet to look into if I’m stuck with any problems and have questions 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,459,"There are many resources that I have in my life. My biggest resource that I have is my family. I know that I can always go to them if I need help or advice. After that I have my 2 best friends back home that I can go to if I heave a problem or need advice. I also have managers at my work that I can go to if I need help, or more hours. Another resource I have are my roomates. They all help me out when I need help or am stuck in a sticky situation. There are many other resources I have, but those are some of the main ones. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,460,"The main resource that i have would be my group of friends. We not only solve our hw together but discuss the conceptual of the problems. It helps me a lot when I could discuss something that I learned to someone. For example, even in lab if i were to explain how there is a relationship with the distance and E field I could explain it and would help myself to reconsider what my thought were. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,452,My resources are things I can use to my advantage. My resources can come from anywhere and anyone. My resources are the most valuable tools I have because without them I am useless. My resources are my learning tools and they help me progress as time passes especially when I need my resources in a timely fashion. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,468,"I’m extremely sleep deprived at the moment but this lollipop is holding me down. My biggest support is my mom, she is extremely given and sweet. She’s always there for me. Another resource I can use at SFSU is gator groceries which comes through for food. I know I don’t use my resources that much but it’s nice knowing they’re there. I know if I needed help with scholarships there are workshops I can take and advisors I can talk to. If I’m struggling financially I can always run to my mom. She’s a ride or die "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,453,"What resources do I have. I have many resources that I have access to. When it comes to the aspect of school there are many tutor and lab professors even professors that I can turn to as a resource. I can also turn to my homework, text book as study resources.  When it come to my home life I can turn to my family and friends as resources. I can even sometimes turn to my job as a resource at times. Now thinking about how many resources that I have at my disposal I have way more than I initially imagined."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,474,"I have different recourses for this class. I have the instructor, and the physics text book online from web assign. If I have any questions there are also office hours to attend to if I have further questions. I also have the internet, which is a good resource. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,205,Im very lucky to have always lived off campus and been living in the same place the whole time. It has allowed ti me to establish a very homey feeling in my neighborhood and build relationships with people in the restaurants and shops. Im very grateful to have a family that is always very willing to support me as well as roommates who genuinely care about me and I them. Im very grateful that I get more financial aid than I need which just lets me live a more peaceful and at ease life than many other college students. It has allowed me to focus on school rather than work and school. Things such as calfresh and gatorgroceries are readily available which also makes life much easier
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,469,"My parents, my aunt and uncle, my friends here at school and elsewhere, transportation, the internet, Khan Academy, my previous professors, CARP, the campus library, the De Anza student library that I can still use, my laptop, my cell phone, Chegg, Chegg again, the online library database"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,466,"As a student, we have a lot of resources without even realizing it. We use these resources day-to-day as if it is apart of us. Some resources is at school. We have resources for every class that we take. Many of the science and math classes have supplementary classes worth a unit, but even if a lot of classes do not have those, there are still every professor that has office hours. We also have resources at home after or before school. When we are stuck on a problem we can go to our parents, siblings or even friends for a solution. If they do not know the answer to the problem that you ask then when in doubt we can look at our textbook or even the internet. There are plenty of resources that we use, but we just do not think of much of it because we use it everyday so casually that it does not seem as a big deal to us. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,463,"Currently, my life is most abundant in physical resources.  I feel that SFSU does a good job of providing me opportunities for education and advancement in my field.  However, I would argue that I lack the interpersonal connections of someone who truly utilizes his surroundings for support off-campus.  Sometimes I feel that my life outside of school doesn't really achieve what I had once hoped when I was younger, but on the other hand, I like to think that most of my time is spent on my courses and whatnot.Additionally, I see that my particular mode of residence does not really allow for interpersonal connections.  I really do enjoy the benefits of being a student on campus.  I use the library for printing often, go to the engineering lounge between classes, and I actively seek out opportunities on campus for involvement."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,467,"The library and office hours, but I need to tell myself to use them more."
