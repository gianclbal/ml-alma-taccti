2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,468,"Well, my personal value is the earth is very important and we, humans, should be doing everything we can to prevent not only ours but the earth’s destruction as well. With my major I want to work with more renewable or safer technology. So basically building/creating cars or transportation that are earth friendly. I don’t know how yet cause it’s complicated but yea."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,469,"I like working on cars, particularly vintage cars. My first car was a 1967 Chevelle, and I’m working on my uncle’s 1957 DeSoto, as well as my new project, a 1974 Corvette. These experiences made me want to be a mechanical engineer to not only look forward to new technologies, but also to revise and improve upon existing tech. I also grew up watching The Jetsons and Back to the Future, so making cars fly would be a top priority for me. I want to help move the world forward while keeping one eye on the past."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,450,After I finish my degree I would like to get into electric vehicles and autonomous vehicle industry so I can contribute in making our society safe and efficient. I believe EV's and autonomous vehicles is our future and I want to be part of it. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,464,The intersection would be I value seeking the truth and I believe the science community does the same.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,205,I have a very natural curiosity that I think I can relate to with many others in the scientific community. My curiosity leads me to pay very close attention to my every day interactions and environment which leads me noticing phenomena and relationships i find interesting. I work at the exploratorium and also volunteer there. Curiosity and exploration is something thats very much expressed and encouraged so being able to connect with people like that and dive into scientific and mathematical conversations very much reassure my love for my major. There’s also something about scientists and engineers that makes then love problems and issues that make them scratch their head. These things are viewed as fun challenges rather than issues or barriers which is something i very much relate to.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,203,Science always has been interesting to me like discovering new things and how my personal values intersect with scientific community values is by family
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,463,"I want to explore more into fluid flow and how certain shapes respond to movement through a medium. I’m not super sure what specifically I want to get into with this interest, but I definitely know that I want to pursue some sort of masters degree after getting my bachelors. I really like education and school and learning, and honestly I wouldn’t be upset studying anything within the realm of physical science as long as it meant that I could still be a student.I used to be really into application-based studies, which was why I got into engineering in the first place. But as I’ve progressed through my classes I find myself liking the theoretical side of the curriculum more than that experimental side. I think that this aligns decently with my chosen interest of flow in that it was roots in real-world problems (i.e. aerodynamics) but relies on really interesting properties of physics and fluid flow."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,460,"As the name suggests a scientific community can be defined as a group of scientists working on issues related to science and technology and is an extremely diverse network of interacting scientists.Science involves the logical reasoning involving every phenomena taking place in nature. On doing problems in science, me as a students will identify a problem and look for rational ways to answer them. In doing so, I understand the logic behind the happenings in day to day life and learns more about scientific community. For e.g. on doing a chemistry project on the concept of pH, I know the meaning of pH and also learn how this pH could affect the biological activity of living organisms in general. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,465,"I believe that the personal values that everyone should have intertwine with the scientific community values. Honesty, attention to detail, integrity, and focus to name a few are almost expected from scientific research and I believe that it should be expected from people too even outside of the science. I believe that ""scientific community values"" shouldn't be something that would ever even be an issue because it should already be in place and it is. When experimental data is found to be falsified the data is then null and unusable and people should be treated the same. When new data is provided that someone has falsified an idea to you ,or lied to you, your trust for them has then been compromised or then null. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,457,"Personally, I like when things make sense in my head so in that way I can perform better in a daily basis. It could go from understanding the root causes that led to a certain event in my life to understanding the reasoning behind we are ""solving for x"" in a mathematical/chemical equation. In this way, I can apply the knowledge to both scenarios in future situations. I also try to my best to be organized, and that is something valuable on my scientific community because in order to make a certain thing happen, we need to keep track of the process to deepen our knowledge. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,452,"I don't believe my personal values intersect with scientific community values since I do like science and that it's facts-based, I tend to shift my personal values to being based on facts and less of by emotion when making judgments or estimates. Science is probably my favorite subject and when you get down into the nitty gritty, there involves a lot of process and the thing about that is it's always thought out pretty thoroughly and explained with great detail. As a person, I value that idea because there's a lot more than meets the eye when it comes to people, we don't see all of someone by just looking at them."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,473,"I believe my personal values intersect with the scientific community because like many people in the science field, I am always asking questions on how things came to be and how we can improve them. I also believe in the phrase ""no question is a dumb question."" There are so much to learn through every day life; asking questions gives us knowledge. I once heard the saying ""We learn more looking for answers to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself."" It's not the answer we learn the most from. It is the connection we make during the process of looking for it. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,454,"Growing up it was quite difficult figuring out my personal values but when I enlisted into the military the basic values they instilled into us was honor, courage and commitment. Integrating these basic values and other values I picked up has taught me to have pride in my work, to not be afraid of the unknown and to have integrity in what I do."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,474,"It intersects with science, I like science and math. I also want to work on robotics "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,455,"I do not know what is referred to as scientific community values but I will assume that it means the restraint, honesty, open mind, and evidence that scientists should convey. My personal values are all of those, I fell like these values should be present in humans no matter what group you belong in. I believe there should always be a sense of restraint from judging people without evidence (innocent until proven guilty). There should always be honesty unless it is dangerous to someone’s well being, in that case let the individual know of the severity. Always have an open mind, there are billions of unique and similar opinions to ours out there. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,470,How do my personal values intersect with scientific community values?My personal goals are to get a degree in Computer Engineering and get a government job. I have a few friends that currently work as GS or for the state and they told me that it was good work. As far as scientific community goes I feel like alot of people in the scientific community tend to work for the government. They fund alot of research projects and development projects as well. I think this is the safest route for me.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,453,"Something the really bothers me about the scientific community is that they really do not value the life of all living creatures. Animal trials are a big example of this. I understand the importance of testing, but on other living things just to ensure that humans are no affected is not something I stand by. Us as humans we are selfish. We only think about ourselves. This is one big factor that has my personal values conflict with the scientific community values. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,466,"My personal values intersect with my scientific values through many things. When I first started college I wanted to prove a lot of people wrong. When I get this engineering degree it will show proof that I can endure anything that comes my way and that I can face hardships then overcome them. Through the years I have thought about changing my major many times, but I knew that I cannot do that. I need to prove to myself that I can do it. I can learn any of the math and science that is thrown at me. This will help me in the future with a job due to learning everything in the classroom into hands-on-experience. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,462,"A personal value that I share with the scientific community is the desire to understand how the natural world works. There is so much that has already been discovered, but as much time and effort as it is taking me to learn what our species has already discovered, my ultimate goal is to add to our current understanding. Besides the value of contributing new knowledge to science, I also value educating others. I am very grateful to the scientific educators who have helped me understand scientific concepts over the years, and I feel it is my privilege and responsibility to continue this tradition with anyone else I meet who wants to understand what we know about the science that describes our reality. So, my shared values are helping to build the scientific community and contributing new understanding to science."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,472,"I believe my own personal values interline with scientific community values pretty similarly. I try to keep my work ethically and morally conscious of respect and peace. I don't conduct acts based solely on curiosity and knowledge, I back it up with logical reasoning that supports my ethical and moral values as well. If I was to do something that was perhaps going against one of my axioms but for the greater good, I would have to heavily weigh the pros and cons and consider all my options before breaking an axiom from my personal values. One personal value I have for example is my belief that we should never have to severely inflict physical harm on a sentient being for scientific discoveries."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,467,Not much that I could think of. Ethics and morals in experimentation are important to me if I did think of something.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,451,"I consider results-oriented-thinking to be one of the most dangerous mentalities out there. That just because we got the right outcome doesn't necessarily mean we took the right steps. Likewise, in the sciences (or even math), you might somehow get the right answer by using a wrong equation. However, that doesn't change the fact that your approach to the problem was empirically incorrect and getting the right answer was no more than luck - which will eventually run out. This is a manner of thinking that I wish more people had shared, but seems that the default is to assign causality to things rather than looking deeper."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,461,"I think my it's hard to think of values that intersect with the scientific community because I personally don't feel there is enough representation within the scientific community of the values I stand with. I am interested in going into a field of computer science where there is a voice for those who don't have one, such as minorities, women, people in the LGBTQ+ community, people of color, black people, homeless people, incarcerated prisoners, low income people etc. However, sometimes I feel like there is not enough room for me. I feel like computer science is a male dominated field. I feel discouraged when I'm in a classroom of 50 people and only see 10 girl. I feel discouraged and when I find groups in the scientific community who represent what I stand for I am thankful but I think that teachers in the field don't do enough to discuss the disproportionality."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,471,"the way my interests intersect with science is how everything around me functions. last semester i took a life  science class and it was very interesting to me. we studied everything from our own biology to the weather patterns around us and even a little about space and our role in the solar system. i also took a physics 1 a year ago and i really enjoyed that class because it took real life situations and turned them into problems we could solve with math. my favorite subject is math and i liked how i could finally apply it to real world problems. before taking that class if i was given a problem i feel like i have all the tools to get an answer but just could put it into writing, but physics made it possible while not making it much more difficult. "
