2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,454,"Having online classes has made my learning and self-care quite difficult. The campus library is closed and my internet connection at home is poor. I usually I don't have a problem with online classes, but it is noticeable that everyone is having a difficult time trying to transition their courses online. As long the professors and lab instructors are understanding and lenient, I believe we all can make it through this semester."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,211,"I have not liked the impact that online classes have had on myself thus far. i think that I need much more time and patience when it comes to understanding deadlines and priorities because when you are at home, it is way too easy to feel relaxed and comfortable when you shouldn't be. I think that I have learned from this semester and I am ready for the future that is ahead of me. I think that I will be able to be on top of all of my classes and ahead because of how much of a hard time I have had thus far. I am truly grateful for teachers as students because we have no idea how hard it is on you guys as a unit.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,450,"Online learning has helped me overcome my difficulty of time and space where it has given me an opportunity to learn and build my knowledge and skills without sacrificing my regular activities. Although I would prefer face-to-face learning since it is more interactive and students are able to resolve problems with their teachers on the spot whereas online learning happens through video and sometimes its hard to understand due to network connectivity on either end.  Also if there are questions on the materials that are covered we have to contact professor through email or post on discussion on iLearn which could take time to get a respond from the instructor.  For self-care during this #stayhome my wife and I have made plans to get enough sleep, eat right, exercise and we also cook for fun."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,473,"It has taken me a long time to adjust to the online classes, and I am still adjusting to them. I feel that since the pandemic a lot more responsibility has fallen on me. I struggle to keep up with my classes. I have 5 younger siblings and family members that are at home now. Because I am the oldest I have to stay on top of them a lot more to make sure they are doinbg their homework. On top of that, I have to help my mom with her grocery shopping, clean up after the kids, and make sure they eat. My mom has a disabilty so I have to help out a lot more. I worry for my well-being. It feels like this will never end. I worry about my classes because I'm not learning from them. I do what I can through out the week, then find myself playing catch-up with my classes. I just want all of this to be over and to go back to the way they were. But one can only hope. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,462,"Now that I have readjusted my life, online classes are a blessing and a curse. I feel less stressed in that I don't have to commute everyday or scrape by to afford living in the City since I moved back to my parents' house in Florida, but I feel a loss of community being physically disconnected from my instructors and peers. The transition to an online format has worked well for some classes, but for others I miss the small group discussions that allowed me to engage more with the material and hear others' thoughts. Expectations for some of my classes have changed to include more assignments, and it has been difficult to figure out what the new expectations are and to keep track of what is due when. For example, my physics professor got sick, so I now have a new instructor who holds lectures on different days at a time that coincides with another class I am taking, so I can't attend lectures and rely entirely on checking iLearn and making sure I catch emails to learn what is expected of me and not miss assignments. I have been staying with my parents, and for self-care I have been going on runs and walks with them and playing with the family dog. These have been great forms of self-care. For my learning, I made a list of all my classes and immediately write down assignments and their due dates when I hear about them or see them posted on iLearn. I then prioritize all of the lectures and assignments on my list so I have a clear idea of what I need to get done each day."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,460,"Personally I never took online classes before, and right now since I moved back with my parents; I don't have my private space. Its really hard for me to motivate myself to study hard because I get distracted easily. Simple as the smell of the food while m taking classes, makes me wanna leave the meeting and grab a bite. It has really been tough also because of the internet connection and some dumb people who leaves their mic on. Last week in our lecture, he had few unknown people who were disturbing the whole class. So, our professor had to create a new meeting.  As per the self care, I pretty stay inside my home. Every other day I go out running but, I make sure I don't touch anything and go out with facial mask. I ever maintain 6ft distance from any other individual walk in the street. I don't make direct contact with my mouth and hand or eyes. And as soon as I get home I take a hot shower. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,458,I've not done well with online classes before and tried to stay away from it as much as I can. The present educational situation does add to the anxiety. I do am worried about my current class standing for this class.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,467,"Online classes have made attending morning classes a lot easier, but can't get the help if I need it. However, I feel like my learning isn't too impacted"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,466,"Online classes have impacted my learning in many ways. It makes me feel unmotivated, but I have to attend each online class to make sure I do not fall behind. The impact at home makes me feel cramped with my family. It feels as if they do not understand that I have to go to class too and work on homework. They expect me to drop everything and help with whatever they need while I am in class. They also try to talk to me while I am in class. What I do for self-care is that I take a long bath just to relax and get away from everything or I just take some naps. I am concerned that this whole online classes will make me not retain anything that we had learn in this past semester."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,457,"I think that online classes had greatly impacted how I learn, because I don't longer have the option to talk one on one with my professors as easily. Also, I think it is difficult because for example, for my comm class, we are supposed to do speeches ""live"" to help us overcome our fears and so on, but now, it's just harder to do so and give our full potential as we can easily look at our scripted outlines. However, I still try to motivate myself to finish my assignments and to ask questions through email if something is not clear. Meanwhile, I'm just trying not to overthink stuff, sleep a little longer in the mornings since I don't longer commute, and eat more often. I'm just a little concerned for my grades, and other than that I am doing whatever I can to take preventive measures at home. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,474,"I have not been able to learn. It's very hard to keep up with the work. Sometimes i procrastinate and I am missing the teacher interaction that i paid for. I don't think this is at all fair for us students. With my self-care, i've just been resting and making sure i am eating healthy. I hope all this is over soon. That would be nice."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,469,"Still having difficulties absorbing information during classes, i find myself getting distracted by everything else I have to do. The instructors are all doing there best, which I really appreciate but it doesn't really help, at least for me. I've been trying to spend an hour or two a week working on my project car in the backyard, just so my brain can do something physically tangible, but it doesn't feel the same. Everything is starting to just blur together. The only reason I know what day it is is because I log into the Zoom meetings for different classes each weekday. I was trying to eat healthier to avoid putting on the COVID-15 (the 15 pounds on average people are putting on in quarantine), but that only lasted so long, and the 15 pounds came. I'm hoping that Fall courses aren't online. I need to learn this material and I honestly don't think I can online. I've already had to back out of my summer courses I was planning to take, putting me one more academic semester behind."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,464,"Online classes are fine for me. I have taken online classes before so I am used to it. However, I only took one online class each semester. And now that all the classes are online, it is quite difficult to keep me motivated and on track sometimes.For self-care, I try to exercise at least for 15 mins a day to keep me active and try to avoid unhealthy sleeping habits.One of the concerns I have would be for my mental health as sitting all day at home can be overwhelming sometimes."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,453,"In my opinion, I am not a huge fan of online classes. I feel lazier and less motivated to perform well in school given that I'm not in the classroom setting. While I totally understand why we are sheltered in place and why we have turned to online classes I just don't enjoy the environment. As for my learning, I can see that it has suffered in regards to attending and paying attention to the lecture. I will always have a paper out when I am in the lecture, but I may not pay attention and because I am on my computer may go and do other things rather than listen to the lecture. As for my well being, I am doing fine just a bit bored, to say the least. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,459,"Switching to online learning has greatly effected me. I a, not very good at learning over a computer, personally I feel like I have to be in the classroom being taught by a teacher to better understand the material. So far it hasn’t been too bad, however I do hope that next semester we go back to in person learning. For self care, I have been working out a lot to keep me active. I noticed I feel better after working out rather than sitting or laying down all day. I am concerned about how hard it will be next semester. I feel like there will be material from classes this semester that I will not understand as well than if I were learning in person. I am also concerned for how this lockdown will effect me physically, dealing with sports and other activities. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,203,Online classes impacted me in both a positive way and a negative ways honestly. I don't have to drive 3 hours to SF because I am from Sacramento but at the same time it's hard studying from home and I know a lot of my friends share this experience. I dont know how long this will last because I've been told this might go through the fall semester but I hope to get motivated again since it's hard to not go outside and do things.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,472,"This past month has been pretty crazy, throughout the panic and life altering changes that have been made to our daily lives, I somehow have managed to keep a relative peace of mind and continue going through my classes. I haven't dropped any classes despite being in 7, and my entire family has managed to stay safe and healthy. Learning has become much more difficult despite the ease of being at home. A lot of things must now be self taught and I don't have access to a lot of the resources I did at school. I feel like reaching out and asking for help is much more difficult too because it takes up a lot more time, and I frankly feel like I'm annoying to people but this has only pushed me to force myself to learn on my own. As far as exercise goes the only activity I have is going for a walk around my neighborhood, I feel like this lifestyle is going to stick around for a long time perhaps more than 3 months so I'm going to have to figure out a plan on how I'm going to manage my physical activity. A lot of my teachers are understanding and I feel like they have become quite a bit more lenient when it comes to grading and deadlines which I'm grateful for."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,451,"Currently, it's definitely harder for me to absorb & interact with a lot of the material for classes. Being a very visual & learn-by-doing type learner, it is definitely much more difficult for me to get the most out of lectures through the online medium, particularly in some of my classes that are spent with a decent portion troubleshooting Zoom. Some lectures have now just become professors reading along with the textbook without making use of any sort of whiteboard/visuals emulating tools which makes it difficult to grasp & interact with the material being presented.Self-care wise I don't think I left the home (other than to walk my dog) in nearly a week. I wear gloves any time I go out and am drinking lots of water & green tea. To reduce stress, I'm resolving to not read/watch the news as often as I did and I've picked up painting Warhammer miniatures to keep my sanity during the day."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,465,Online learning has been somewhat of a struggle for me. I usually do not enjoy taking online courses due to the fact that I don’t trust myself to not miss a single assignment. See as though now I have no choice but to take all of my classes online nothing has changed. I have missed more than just one assignment since I have been home. I have a lot of trouble remembering to do online assignments for some reason and it’s not like I don’t want to do them. I often find myself remembering to check for any assignments anywhere between 30 to -3 hours before the due date of all assignments. I think that being at home for all this time has not been healthy for me mentally. Being cooped up in my room all day and night has not been ideal. I fear that if COVID-19 does not cool down I may be unable to return to San Francisco. My parents have been very fearful of the pandemic and have been updating me on the daily death toll.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,455,"I get distracted very easily and I live in a small one bedroom apartment with other people, so having online classes has been challenging because I feel claustrophobic and uncomfortable to join in on Zoom sessions or try to figure out complicated assignments because I feel like my roommates are paying attention. I get irritated and give up quicker on a lot of things and try to mitigate this by doing exercises in a small room in the apartment. I still feel encaged and easily irritated most of the time. An aspect I like about being able to have classes from home is that it makes time management flexible and long distance travel nonexistent, but this would be best if I had my own room or if I was allowed to go places like the gym or library. Having everyone staying at home at all times just gets me irritated just even thinking about it. Right now I am in a small bedroom that I share with two other people while my roommates are outside talking. I am about to go crazy, I don't even want to continue with school anymore but I will do it just because I am behind already."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,205,"Every day has been very unstable. I have days where I'm up early, moving fast, getting lots of cleaning and homework done, and I'm feeling great. But I'm finding that the off days have increased much more due to the lockdown. On my off-days, I can't seem to get anything done because even though I have personal projects that I'm excited about that help to zone me out of the lockdown, I feel guilty when I work on them but have homework to do. The main issue is that its been very difficult to stay motivated with online classes so as I procrastinate those and don't work on my personal projects due to guilt, I get nothing done and end up feeling like a horrible slob all day. It's a weird off-feeling of not being motivated and feeling cloudy on the inside. My ADHD thrives with online classes as I can't sit in my living room for all my classes, my homework, and just day to day living. I have tried studying in different rooms and even outside which helps but it only does so much before my brain completely drops off. I'm worried that I'm getting depressed because I can see small projections onto my girlfriend who I live with and she has also mentioned a change in personality some days. But the two things that make me the absolute most happy and make me feel the most productive are cooking and gardening. Due to weather, gardening isn't always an option but no matter how bad I feel, I'm always up to do some cooking so I have invested much of my time and money into starting a youtube channel. Thanks for doing these stream of consciousnesses and thanks for actually responding to some. It genuinely feels like someone is listening and it has been nice to sit down and write this. I hope you're doing good! I bet its quite the bummer to become a professor but not get to really teach anyone for a while the way its meant to be. Stay safe!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,468,With online classes I don’t feel like I’m learning anymore. I feel disconnected and that I’m just trying to not fail. I hate online classes. I’m doing nothing for self care. We are in a pandemic I know I’m doing better than most people and I believe this is the time to be considerate of students and know that some have it terrible & are going through a lot. I have a professor right now assigning too many assignments and it’s overwhelming and exhausting.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,461,Online classes are definitely unfamiliar to me. I think this has most negatively impacted my art classes since I can’t be there in person to develop negatives in the dark room. I also think it’s unfair because I can’t get all the resources I have for being helped in person for my major classes which are the hardest. But it’s okay. I think the silver lining is I have more time to work on reading for my pleasure and work on skills I’ve always wanted to work on like reading and coding and writing. For my well being I was exercising at home and trying to not be in my phone as much but it’s hard since I feel like being on my phone is my most accessible coping mechanism. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,452,Having online classes makes a a lot more difficult to learn and especially retain all the information already gathered from the start of the semester. I have already forgotten almost a majority of the stuff I already learned since then and it's not likely gonna get any better as far as really learning the material and understanding what's going on without being able to ask questions directly in presence. I feel that I won't be able to learn as intuitively as I would on campus because at home there are a lot of distractions and the environment doesn't exactly suit me to learn on my own. I will continue to push through but it's not going to be easy and the fact that classes over summer are pushed online is making it even more difficult for those harder classes I'll be taking.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,463,"I live back at home now and go to class within the confines of the house.  I'm not that upset by the venue of online class, but I am definitely appropriately concerned with receiving the best possible education given the circumstances.  Schooling at home is hard due to the available distractions and distance from resources like physical office hours, tutoring, libraries, etc.  I guess I just have to get used to it.  Overall, I don't think online schooling is without value, I just want to ensure that I'm still achieving my learning goals the exact same as if I were back at university.In order to stay mentally and physically fit, however, I have taken it upon myself to engage in some sort of literature, exercise, or other project on top of schooling just so I can have a good creative outlet."
