2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,472,"The Coronavirus has made it much more difficult to study and learn. Despite not having a commute, I at least had a place to study at school and at cafes. But now being at home while my parents are remodeling and requiring a lot of my physical help and time makes it incredibly difficult to put the same amount of focus and attention into my studies as I did before. At first it was manageable, but my family's stress has risen steadily since the start and things have gotten very hard to maintain. Since I'm at home all the time my parents seem to forget that I still have class, despite me reminding them everyday, and having 7 classes with increased amount of work to makeup for lost lecture and in class assignments has led me to being overwhelmed while still trying to maintain my family's lifestyle. Thus leading to me having to leave voids in certain classes to keep up my grades in my main classes. I've seen the extension you've granted and the deadline on the 16th to submit all labs, I will try to get as much done as I can and submit everything I have by then."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,461,I'm not sure yet since we are just now getting into the groove of things but I think it'll affect me being able to express confusion about concepts. I think its just raised a lot of questions for what's to come. I know that the whole semester is online now which is crazy. Im mostly upset about classes like this one and my photography class because those were classes that I enjoyed going to and where I was able to have a hands-on learning experience. I just am worried about my grades now and how this will affect my academic progress.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,470,How has the coronavirus effected your semester? The coronavirus has effected my semester by making all of my class on line.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,451,"One of my biggest concerns regarding the coronavirus in regards to this course is that I had been sharing a lab manual with people from my lab group and hadn't bought one of my own. I'm nervous about whether or not I'll be able to follow along with the work or what alternatives (if any) there might be. For my other courses, some of my professors are not very adept with Zoom, which can make lecturing a bit frustrating as it can be difficult to communicate with the instructor or to even really absorb the material - as they might be restricted just to showing scanned portions of the textbook and reading along, and at that point you wonder ""why even sit through the lecture if he's just reading the book?"". Probably my biggest concern is missing content because of technical issues or concerns or just not getting it because the medium is limited. Also, less related but, it's really annoying to join Zoom sessions where people haven't muted on their ends, so there's a lot of background noise."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,205,"Luckily I am one of the people who have not been devastated by the effects of the virus. I do have to find a new roommate which is not only tricky at this time but it is a health concern to bring in someone new. Besides that, I've mostly been doing my best to adjust to this whole zoom system and adjust to having this much time. It has really thrown me off my routine and just feels weird. But besides that, it's been very nice to finally have time to deep clean and organize my house as well as do tons of work in my garden. We've taken on some projects which have me working with my hands more than I have all semester. This includes wiring LED circuits for our mushroom farm and installing a fan in the growing bin. Im trying to take this time to really analyze my life and my environment to help myself understand what it is out of life that I want and how I want to go about that. Im coming to find that being released from this whole system and being able to pour time into the community, engineering projects, and gardening/nature has made me feel way less stressed and confined. I feel more productive in a way."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,455,"I had specific plans set up for my success after life in the military. I am already behind in school so I decided to maximize my courses in order to graduate next year with enough money saved up to be able to settle down and for in case of emergencies. I invested my savings and so far have lost over $10,000 in investments and currently everything seems like my plans might need to shift. I do not have any motivation for any of my classes, my only distraction was going to the gym and now I cannot do that. However, I am grateful to God that at least my family and I are healthy, we have a place to live, and we have resources to keep us afloat. I will take this as a wake up call and an opportunity to keep investing. There is no way I am pulling my money at a loss, I know things will get better even if it takes years, so I will continue investing while planning ahead. This is all new for me, a whole new fog of war (the fear of the unknown) that I've experienced in the military but I know I am ready for whatever is to come. Stay safe and healthy. Blessings."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,462,"The coronavirus has drastically affected my semester. When campus closed and the Bay Area received the order to shelter in place, it became very difficult for me to find a place to shower, study, and charge my electronics. I’m originally from Florida, and I have been living in a van while attending school in San Francisco. This is normally a very manageable situation, but like I said, the measures taken to prevent the spread of the coronavirus made this arrangement no longer sustainable. I left the city once President Mahoney announced classes will be online for the rest of the semester and have been driving east towards Florida, though I often can’t travel very far in a day because I have to stop in places where I know I can get access to the internet so I can attend Zoom classes, and some days I don’t drive because I have to study, do homework, or take exams. I think once I get to Florida where I will have reliable power and internet and access to a shower, I will be able to adapt to the new normal for the rest of the semester, but it will still take a couple more days for me to get home, and the past couple weeks have been trying to say the least."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,468,"Well, i don’t think I've been effected as much as other people in worse situations than me, but I’m currently unemployed wondering how I’m going to pay rent. Online lectures aren’t for me, I’m stressed out. All new materials is flying over my head, the countless emails I keep getting is making me anxious. I have a laptop but the camera doesn’t work so I don’t know how I will do the online exams which requires your camera to be on. I want some partial refund back. Questions: do we have zoom sessions? "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,452,"Concurrently, the virus hasn't affected any family members, friends, or me so far as far as health but it is making everything difficult to do especially with going all classes being online for the rest of the semester. Getting groceries is that much harder as well when a lot of essential items are being sold out. When we're at home it's harder at least for me to wake up in time for early classes which you don't get that kind of discipline when you know you have to be somewhere for class at a certain time but since all classes are online now, there's going to be a lot of catching up to do on my own and especially not getting distracted at home is one of the hardest things to avoid..."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,466,"The coronavirus effected my semester through many different ways. One of the reasons is being afraid to leave my house. The news make it seems as if I touch anything outside my house I will contract the virus and spread to everyone at my home. It also affected my studies. I am more of a hands on learner which is why I like going to lab and visualize everything that is going on, but that is out the door now since all our classes are on online now. I will have to study harder now due to not being able to visualize and do hands on experience for Physics. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,473,"With everything going on, coronavirus has impacted me financially and emotionally. Doing activities online for classes now make it hard to focus. I feel that I cannot engage as much as I would on an in person basis. Hours at work have been cut, and the Pantry that they offered here at state has been suspended. I know these are difficult time for many people world wide. I feel for those who have been laid off during this time. Im fortunate to still be receiving some hours. I just worry that this only the beginning, and that things will start to get worse. Nobody knows how long we will be on lockdown. It is really scary and I hate not being able to be with my family at this time. I fear if I go to visit them I could put them at risk. All of this feels like I'm in a moive. It's hard to focus on school when there is so much going on around us. It has been very challenging. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,467,"Admittedly the coronavirus has gotten me complacent, but I am more readily available to attend 8 AM classes"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,458,"When it rains it pours and it is pouring hard. I just have to weather the storm. Before the school closure, I got into an accident at work which led to my termination. To top it off, I am still resolving an IRS issue from last year. My first two semesters at SFSU have been dealt with circumstances outside of school that makes it hard to focus on my academic responsibilities.   	The school closure and online instructions possess another challenge to me. I've depended on my instructors for guidance as I am slow to learn. Now that we all are in self-quarantine, I do worry about my family, academic and financial responsibilities."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,203,Its affected me alright since I dont have to commute but it does suck that everything is closed
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,464,"Shifting all the classes and labs has been a little hard to deal with. Some classes like this physics lab itself would have been better in person like the way it was. I am a little concerned about how my grades would turn out but since they say health is wealth, approach to provide online classes is greatly appreciated."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,459,"The corona virus has really effected me this semester. I have had to leave San Francisco due to the virus and come back home. I no longer work because of the virus, and it ended our waterpolo season which we were not too thrilled about. I am worries to see how long all of this lasts, it sounds like it will last through the summer and possible into next school year. I am hoping that classes next year will not be online because I am a visual learner and it helps me to be inside of the classroom. I am also already noticing that my social life is starting to become extinct due to the virus. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,474,COVID_19 has effected my semester pretty bad. It is hard to keep up with work and it's also hard to maintain a good study schedule because I used to go to the library to study. It was a hard adjustment to make. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,460,"The virus as all we know, the worst thing it has done is by moving things online for the semester. Me, personally I hate online studies, and something like labs it don't make sense. But I know its for our own safety. The virus has just not effected me of my family, it's a worldwide thing now. We as a family need to stay alert and apply all the safety measure by our sides, and me and family are doing the best. This virus is the most dangerous thing yet me and my family came across after the destructive earthquake in Nepal, 2015. So, it has reminded me also the value of ones life and others too ."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,469,"I am a very tactile learner, so having the campus shut down and in person classes suspended has had a very negative impact on my learning experience. I also have ADD, for which I was prescribed medication in the past, but managed to work past it to the point where I no longer needed it by focusing on the structure of my classes and setting myself to a schedule. However, with all of my classes now being online, the digital interface as well as having all lectures for all of my classes almost entirely eliminated the structure I rely on to overcome my ADD, making it very difficult for me to keep up. Getting put back on medication for it requires an appointment and a re-diagnosis, both of which are impossible given that it is not on the list of reasons my healthcare provider will allow an appointment. On top of that, my responsibilities outside of school have more than doubled, as my grandparents are in their 80's and have dementia, so I have had to do a lot more to take care of them during shutdown, and I have been getting pressure from my whole family to temporarily move to Missouri to take care of my Uncle. Oh and my girlfriend thinks we should ""take a break"" until this whole coronavirus thing is over, so focusing on school when its through a screen has been very difficult for me."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,454,The Coronavirus had made it difficult on a personal level. There has been 2 deaths in the family and for the second funeral some could not have attend due to the lockdown. During the funeral week we had to provide for family and friends and ran low on supplies and essentials. The coronavirus had cause people to panic buy and hoard on supplies causing issues for other people. I have emailed you with my current status and appreciate that you are not to worried about late work. I greatly appreciate your understanding. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,211,The coronavirus has effected my semester immensely because it is extremely difficult to understand upper division classes while you are taking classes online. I need that one on one support or other support from classmates in order the material that is covered. i think that should have put the school year on hold due to the coronavirus but I understand that isn't a possibility. I think that we will all be okay as long as everyone stays happy and healthy. You can only move forward. Win the day!
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,463,"Obviously the shutdown has affected my physical learning spaces, but I've taken the opportunity to refocus my efforts in studying and working efficiently.  I also work a different job now, but the time I spend off is generally more productive.  I find myself thinking about engineering and school topics more when I'm not in lecture.  Additionally, I think that thinking about school comes with the realization of how much more ideal and engaging in-class stuff is, but overall I'm finding that there are more benefits to distanced schooling than I originally anticipated."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,457,"I think the coronavirus has effected my semester in a weird way. This, because it made an impact in all my classes, the schedule was changed and it left me really uncertain about my assignments, midterms and school overall. I'm still concern in how this semester is going to be, because I never taken online classes, and having to kind of ""teach myself"" the subjects it's going to be challenging. But, at the same time I'm glad the school took preventative steps to keep us safe during this time of chaos. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,453,"The coronavirus has effectively derailed my semester. I am not a big fan of online classes this is why I have chosen to take in-person classes so having to switch to online sessions has hindered me a bit. I totally agree with the decisions of the University and understand why we have gone totally online, i am just not a big fan of the format. I accept that classes need to resume and though i am not a big fan of the online session i will continue to attend class and participate fully.   "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,465,The coronavirus has definitely been an obstacle recently. In San Francisco I live in the dorms. Recently SFSU send an email to the residents telling us that we can no longer live there for the time being. This became a big reason as to why I have been stressed recently. I have gathered my belongings and have flown back to San Diego where my family lives. Hearing about the recent lockdown of San Francisco and San Jose has me worried not only for the friends and family that I have in the bay area but also for what will happen to our classes in the future. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0232,--,2,450,"At first it wasn't so bad hearing about this virus. when things started getting worse and more people started getting tested positive and face to face classes got cancelled it got scary. This is the first time I am experiencing something like this. My wife has been working from home since beginning of march and my work place had stopped providing us with food and it all became tough. I have to do online classes now and also cook my meals to take it work. It has been a tough ride till now. my company just announced they will be closed for 3 weeks so it might be a little easy just taking care of school work at home. I am not a big fan of online/remote learning, I would prefer face to face classes for better understanding of the topics and its easier to ask questions when the professor is right there. But since this is a thing we can't choose its best for everyone to maintain the distance and stay heathy. "
