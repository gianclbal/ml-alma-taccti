Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,745,"I grew up in the east bay, and I always wanted to live in San Francisco because of all the opportunities. I am here at San Francisco state University because I want to get a good education in order to move on and go to medical school, and become a surgeon. I am also here at San Francisco state because i love the diversity and opportunity that is all around me here. I am here as a biology with a concentration in physiology major, and my goal is to learn as much biology as possible before i get to medical school in order to take my knowledge with me and apply it in medical school. I am taking this science course because the first 2 weeks of organic chemistry, i had a few panic attacks and was extremely worried for how i will end up doing do in the course. I have heard lots of scary things about organic chemistry, so i wanted to take this course In order to do well in the class, especially because i am moving on the organic chemistry 2."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,746,I am here because i am a first generation student and I want to make my parents proud. I am so privileged to be able to be going to college and be able to further my education. I want to finish college and then go to Medial school and be able to become a OBGYN doctor! Helping woman and being able to help and see the a human be created and form is so amazing to me and I find it super interesting and i am hoping that being able to go to college and doing good in all my classes will help me with my dreams come true. I am very lucky to be in such an amazing school and that my parents are able to help me and support me every step of the way. My sister wasn’t able to go to a four year so for my family me being in a four year school is amazing and the fact that I’m the first from my family is amazing and I don’t want to let them down. I am taking this class for extra help because i want to do really good and I want to be able to understand and pass the class with a good grade and actually understand it so that i can do good in the next physics class that i have to take in the future. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,747,"I am in San Francisco because I have always been close with my parents and I wouldn’t know what to do if I were to go somewhere far away from home. Although it does build independence, my parents are the main reason I am the way I am, and for that i am thankful. Moreover, I am a college student because I am the first in my family to go, and I want to have a better life than the one my parents are currently living. It is the least I could do for all the things they have given and taught me throughout my life"
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,585,"Why am I hereI am here in this sci class because I am striving for the best possible grade in the parent class I can get and I believe this SCI course is critical in helping me attain this grade. Despite being a science major, I do not have a natural proclivity for the parent class. In previous courses in this subject, I have not necessarily struggled but have had to work hard to do well. Seeing as my courses are only getting harder and my outside responsibilities are only growing in numbers and in time commitment, I figured that being proactive in my learning was going to be critical this semester. The material formation of this proactiveness has taken form in the SCI class. I had taken a sci class in the past and had found it immensely helpful. What I enjoyed about my previous SCI class so much as the exam prep that they offered and the intimate setting of the class. Sometimes in massive science classes, it can be challenging to have your individual questions answered. While there are office hours offered, sometimes office hours do not work for my schedule or it is so heavily attended that I only am able to ask one question. After having a successful time in sci both emotionally and grade-wise, I knew that it would be advantageous to rejoin a sci class this semester. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,748,"I am here because I always wanted to be involved in the STEM field ever since I have been a little kid. I was first brought in the STEM field when my mother brought me a book about the solar system and the formation of the planets and moons in the solar system. This sparked a natural curiosity inside of me to pursue this knowledge further.Eventually, when I attended high school, I was apart of an internship at the California Academy of Sciences as an education intern who would teach people about the various scientific topics that were being discussed there. During my time there, I started to get more involved with the many biology departments which allow me to set up mentorships with the researchers to develop a love for biology because I have an interest in learning how biology works for the creation of all things that are living on the planet.Another reason why I am here is that I would the first in my family to be able to go to college and pursue a degree in biology. In addition, I am an African American male and there is not a large representation in the STEM fields and  I want to help change that perception."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,582,"The reason I am here today is to strengthen my education as a biology major. Originally I didnot think that I would survive physics and I didn’t for lecture but now here I am in Physics 2. Inall honesty if I had the choice to be taking physics 2 I really wouldn’t. Physics doesn’t click to methe way it does to others. I also heard that physics 2 is a lot more conceptual so I’m a bit moreat ease. I’m taking this class currently to fulfill my prerequisites and my major requirements. Allin all I don’t think the class should be too bad. At the end of the day, I still hope to leave thisclass with some helpful information. Whether it&#39;s for my future biology classes or just in life. Ialso hope to pass the. Class with a b or higher but we will see about that. I’m taking a sci classso I hope that class will give me a better foundation."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,749,"I am in this class because I absolutely want to at least grab a passing grade, if not, an outstanding grade for O. Chem I. And, in sense, by doing taking this tutoring course, I want to also be able to aid my peers in understanding the material that was covered in CHEM 233 lecture, and reinforced in SCI 333. This was mostly due to how horrible my grades from my previous two attempts at Organic Chemistry, but, I am not going to back down and give up just yet. Another reason why I am also in this course is to also keep my mind occupied in order to get through the day, through productive means. My hopes for this class is that I can internalized the important topics covered in lecture and reinforced in this SCI class, and be able to relay/apply this information to my future prospects."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,750,"I am here because I need help with organic Chemistry and the material we are going over. I had to answer the same prompt for cell bio and I basically have the same answer. I like having extra practice with problems I expect will be on the exam so having a course like sci will really help me to be more prepared and ready for what the lecture will bring. I am here because I desperately want and need help with organic Chemistry. I am also here because I noticed everyone else trying SCI courses and showing me how much their grades improved. So I wanted to give it a try! I am here also because my hometown has no high school and I wanted to go to college. I gained my residency in california, allowing me to go to college. Now I'm here and am using sci resources to get better in ochem "
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,342,"I am here for a whole bunch of reasons. I am in this class to help me understand more, and pass Cell bio, so that I may go on to take my upper division electives, and graduate from this school. I am in this city because I go to this school (a little obvious haha). But I also like the vibe of this city, its much different as opposed to the other cities nearby. I love the culture, style, busyness, etc. The reason I go to school is to one day help support my parents, and so that I may have a decent job where I will not have to worry about stability. I would also really like to make a difference in the world so that I can leave a mark (hopefully a good one) for once im gone. I hope this alma journal doesn't sound very repetitive. Ive this same journal for every sci class I have ever taken. I should really start saving these and turning resubmitting them because I basically have the same response each time. Thank you.Im back. The alma journal was onlhy at 182 words. I need a minimum of 200. Im not exactly sure how I managed to finish these last semester. Hopefully I met the word count."
