2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,749,"Whenever I'm faced with challenges in life, I feel overwhelmed with how to deal with loads of tasks being bombarded all at once or consecutively (one burden after another). I tend to freeze up when before trying to lay down a pathway to work on what needs to be done. I know it's bad to get hung up on stuff for too long, so I try my darn best to do something, something productive to get my cognitive gears going. In terms of handling assignments for college, I try my best to communicate with peers or professors to help find a starting point, and work things from there. If I am at an impasse, I take a step back and think of alternative resources that I can use to progress onwards. When time is of the essence, I try to take more riskier approaches that are within the legal confines of what I am tasked to do. Although it is not a great model to live by, I tell myself that ""it is better to get work done than to do nothing at all"". And despite all this workload, that at the time of this essay is a ton given the sudden shift of how classes are carried out, it is daunting to get my stuff together and adapt to this new environment per se. At times like this, as hard as it is for me to not procrastinate, one would have to set aside their distractions and get their work done."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,585,"What I Do When Life Gets Challenging:I do several things when life gets challenging. Usually the first thing I do is take deep breaths. In the past, I have suffered from anxiety and as overly simplistic and dumb as it sounds, taking several deep breaths really helps to ground me. Taking deep breaths forces me to focus on a single simple task which not only forces my heart rate to slow but also distracts me for a few seconds from whatever is causing the stress. While these few seconds don’t remove the problem or the anxiety surrounding the problem, it does demonstrate to my body and mind that whatever the issue, it can not be so terrible because I am still breathing in and out. The next thing I do after breathing is call my mom. My mother and I are extremely close and I relie on her pretty heavily. Whenever there is something that is challenging, she is always the first to hear of it. SPeaking with her not only calms me down but allows me a finite space and time to process and freak out. It is also a good space to work through and discuss the issue. My mother is the ultimate “doer” and is always ready to breakdown a situation in order to find solutions. She is always the person I turn to, rain or shine, when I have even the smallest of problems. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,342,"What do I do when life gets challenging?.. I do quite a few things in combination. I usually enjoy exercising and listening to music to relieve some stress. Talking with friends or family to relieve stress, but to also ask for advice on how I can approach the situations which are causing for the challenges I am facing in life. After this I choose to attack the challenges so that they are no longer an obstacle or a challenge in my path. For things like the corona virus there is not much I can do about attacking the challenge. So what I do is talk to my friends and family as much as possible (online of course).if you cant change something, its best to change your mindset about that something (within reason). if all else fails I enjoy going to the beach. This is a place full of good memories, so surrounding myself in a happy place is beneficial to me, and helps me clear my mind/ think."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,582,"When life gets challenging I tend to let it get to me at times. I’ve been told that I stress myself more than anything else. It’s really difficult at these moments because I begin to get really anxious and it’s hard to carry on with my life/ responsibilities. Many times when I do manage to deal with my challenges, I get myself to the gym where I can release my stress. Once I get my workout in, I go home to make a meal for brain food, and then i’d put together a list of things I need to get done by importance. Usually my workout makes me feel better about myself and I feel more on top of my work with these steps. Most of the time through my challenges, I feel like the world is closing in on my but I motivate myself to get things done. I like to look back and think of all the other challenges that I have already overcome. Once I manage to get past my new challenges I feel even better and as if a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. This is my motivation to get things done and persevere past my hardships."
