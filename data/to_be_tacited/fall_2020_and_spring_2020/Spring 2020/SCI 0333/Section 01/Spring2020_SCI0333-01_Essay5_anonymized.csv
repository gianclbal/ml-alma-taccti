My major is Biology concentration in Physiology I chose this major because one I like biology and that goes with my career pathway. I also wanted to concentrate it in physiology because I like physiology and I love that I can concentrate on it. Choosing my major was not hard at all coming into college I already knew what I wanted my major to be. I like all science classes and so far, my favorite has been Physics class, but I still have many more to take in the stem field.  I like being in the stem field and I can’t wait to continue my journey. Hopefully the classes just get better and better. I really hope that all of this happens. I know that this is a long and hard journey but if other people have done it than so can I. I just have to put my hard work, my mind and soul to this if this is what I truly want in life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,582,"I want to go into the STEM field because I have always been interested in science. For the longest time i’ve always loved science. In elementary school science was my favorite subject and I was always eager to go to school just for science class. Till this day my science classes are my favorite to attend. Although they are the toughest classes, I still enjoy learning new information and gaining new concepts. I also chose the STEM field to get me prepared for my future career. I eventually want to become a Physician's Assistant or anything in the medical field that allows me to work with patients. I’ve always knew I wanted to work with people as I grew older. Originally I wanted to become general practitioner however that requires medical school and a lot of money. Physicians assistants do about the same and still get paid pretty well. I like that physicians assistants get to work with different specialities also. I feel that the STEM field prepares me and allows me to gain the knowledge that I would need to get to where I want to be. It will provide me with all the necessary information to become a physician's assistant."

Environmental science has a range of skills that could be important for future paths. If you choose a STEM Career there are so many career paths you can take which is what is so exciting about it, you also never stop learning because there is something new being discovered and there’s a lot of opportunity for growth which is very important to me because I always want to keep improving. I myself don’t know exactly what career path I want to take yet but I am interested in teaching, environmental advocacy, and resource management"
