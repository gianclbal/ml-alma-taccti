Seeing their journey and how they overcame it has inspired me do better than them. None have graduated from high school or gone to college. I am the first to attend. So when it comes to navigating through college i knew what I wanted to do I wanted to become a doctor and be successful. Doing biology you come across difficult and challenging classes and there were times where I wanted to give up but i couldnt because that isnt an option for me. I set my goal and I will do whatever it takes to complete it. Seeing my mom and dad push themselves made me want to push myself even further. They are what gave me my strength to try and become successful. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,370,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?My family and community have helped me navigate through college because the values I learned from them have influenced the decisions I make. One of the most important values my family and community have taught me is to always keep going when life gets tough, it is always important to not give up because everything worth having takes a lot of effort. Those values help me through college because not all days will be good days in college, you will have days where you won’t feel like you are enough and will probably think about giving up. When I have days like that I always think about my family first, would they be disappointed that I didn’t continue pursuing higher education? Thinking about them always gives me the motivation I need to keep going."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,749,"I believe the community that stood out the most, that has some influence in navigating through college is Kitsap County. The important value that I gained from my community was the importance of collaboration, to promote self-growth in order to build rapport with peers and community members."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,752,"My family has motivated me to do well and never give up for the things I wanted to pursue. My major in SFSU is Biochemistry and so far it has been very challenging. When my parents were around my age they went through plenty of hardships to achieve what they have today and in a way, it inspires me to strive for the best. I do not want to disappoint my parents after what they have been through because they made my life very easy by ensuring that I would not have to go through the types of hardships they experienced. With that being said, in college I try my best to enroll into my major classes to ensure that I will graduate on time while working for my degree. Currently, I am doing well in my classes except for my physics lecture course because of the midterm scores. This summer I will be retaking the physics course so I can stay on track in graduating on time."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,582,"My family has really helped me navigate through a lot of my college experiences. They by far are my biggest motivation and support of college. Not only college, I work towards a successful future for family. My parents have done so much to get me where I am today and I wouldn’t want to make all their hard work for nothing. I am also their oldest child of three and for that reason I feel that I should set an example for my brothers. I feel like the biggest way I can return the favor to them is to do well and make them proud. Eventually, i’ll have a stable job in which I can save to provide for them when they get older. Not just for my brothers and parents but also my future partner and children. This is another big motivation for working towards a successful future because i’d want to provide a stable home and care for my children. Also I don’t want family to be an unstable environment in the future. Because school gets really stressful my family is always supporting me and understand that even when I don’t get the greatest grade, that I tried my best."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,342,"The values my community has given me are putting the majority first before myself. This does not mean I should not take care of myself, rather, that I should also care about those around me. There are many people in this world that are disadvantaged, or need encouragement to reach where they need to be. As for my family, I thank them for instilling in me the ability to never give up, and to finish what I have started. I believe this helped me get through school. Since I was young, no matter what it was. Whether it was swimming, taekwondo, etc., my parents would never let me quite and would encourage me to finish everything. They would show me that the things I loved and wanted to do at one point, were worth fighting for. This struggle would make the end more sweet. For this I am thankful to both my community and family."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,746,"I think my values have helped me become the way I am and grow as an individual. I think that my values have helped me stay focused in school and really just stay in my path. I don’t party, smoke, or drink which helps a lot to stay focused in school and focus on my studying for my exams. I think my family has guided me the best through my experience in college to do my best and to always remember my values because I came to San Francisco alone and my family lives 7 hours away, so they wanted me to do my best and to make good decisions. Also being a first-generation child going to college I am expected to do good and my very best to make my entire family proud. I think family plays a huge roll into values and who you are, and I thank my parents a lot for everything they do and have done for me I’m very grateful. I do not want to let my family down so school is my main focus and I think that is what has helped me a lot through college and also being away from family it is very hard."
