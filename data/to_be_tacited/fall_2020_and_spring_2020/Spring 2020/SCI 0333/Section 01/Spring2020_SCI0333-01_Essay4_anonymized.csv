2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,582,"My family has really helped me navigate through a lot of my college experiences. They by far are my biggest motivation and support of college. Not only college, I work towards a successful future for family. My parents have done so much to get me where I am today and I wouldn’t want to make all their hard work for nothing. I am also their oldest child of three and for that reason I feel that I should set an example for my brothers. I feel like the biggest way I can return the favor to them is to do well and make them proud. Eventually, i’ll have a stable job in which I can save to provide for them when they get older. Not just for my brothers and parents but also my future partner and children. This is another big motivation for working towards a successful future because i’d want to provide a stable home and care for my children. Also I don’t want family to be an unstable environment in the future. Because school gets really stressful my family is always supporting me and understand that even when I don’t get the greatest grade, that I tried my best."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,746,"In this chemistry class I have learned a lot and with previous chemistry classes it has given me the chance to use that previous knowledge and use it in this class. With chemistry I don’t think we realize this every day, but chemistry is in our everyday life’s and we might not notice it, but it really is even thought we might not think about it too much. For example, when we are washing, and we are using detergents there are a lot of chemicals in these and chemistry is used when doing this. Now although it might not be exactly what we learned in class it still uses chemistry and it is used in our everyday life. Another fun thing that is used in the world is recrystallization! Those rock candy’s that we eat are done by a process by crystallization and that is used in regular life. In order for this to occur the repeating pattern extends in three dimensions and the molecules are attracted to each other by intermolecular forces. The binds of the molecules together is weaker than the bonds between atoms in a molecule. These are only two examples but there are many more that we don’t think about."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,1,342,"Overall something that has interested me in this class are the various mechanisms we have covered, and being able to figure out their different transition states, intermediates, etc. I believe this is important and a benefit to society, because understanding this knowledge, we can figure out how to see what products are being produced if we mix different things together or in a solvent. These products can be found in different medications, drinks, makeups, etc. Our everyday lives revolve around chemical reactions. Another thing I think is a benefit, is synthesizing various molecules. More specifically we have talked about synthesizing alcohol. But the general ability of synthesizing molecules is important for the same reasons. Being able to get the molecules we are looking for from different chemical reactions is important in isolating these molecules for future use in the reasons listed above. As our species learns more ways to synthesize molecules or more about these mechanisms that allow us to go from reactants to products, we will also learn more ways of helping people in everyday situations, and in some unfortunate situations, such as disease. There are possibly many applications we may not yet know of, but as time progresses they will be shortly revealed."
