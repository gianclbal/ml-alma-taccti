Challenges are meant to build character and build the structure of someone its not always supposed to be a bad face but also a good face or the future. We love a good challenge. I honestly don't know what else to talk about a challenge because the challenge is just perceived as bad and good."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,760,"Life gets hard sometimes. Sometimes it is a result of our doing, but I find most of the time it’s completely out of my control. Giving up on myself as a result of situations that are out of my control isn’t really worth it. If I don’t get something I want, it just means something better is coming and I appreciate the present moment even moments that don’t seem happy can be looked upon as something that I might miss someday. Let go of desire, I tend to try to be more thankful for everything I have and everything I get. Even when you want something, I will still be happy whether I get it or not. My emotions remain happy or neutral. Also Feeling unmotivated and keep procrastinating helps me analyze my procrastination problem, so I know how to overcome it more effectively. I do not compare myself to others because everyone is different and I do the best I can do. I also try to allow myself to have joy and be happy even for just a small moment and not just focus on my hardship. "

I tend to have a difficult time balancing my challenging classes with my free time outside of school. I tend to find myself spending most of my free time studying rather than taking time to relax and take care of myself. When I do get overwhelmed and stressed from school I try to make time to exercise. All different forms of exercise help me to clear my mind and recenter my body. I also try to get at least 8 hours of sleep every night when I know a stressful time is coming up (such as midterms or finals). I notice when I’m not sleeping enough, I don't function as well as I do fully rested. Sleep and exercise tend to be the main two outlets that I use as a form of self care on a regular basis. Even when life is running smoothly, I still try to incorporate these two fundamentals into my routine to ensure I keep myself healthy in order to accel in school as well as my personal life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,755,When life gets challenging I do several things first of which I panic and freak out on what to do and next I ignore the problems and after that I freak out about the problem and finally realize I have no other option then to deal with it. I deal with my problems in various ways example if a paper is due and I haven’t been able to process the information I do what I do when life gets challenging and in the last moment put in my best foot front and do the paper because doing the paper is better than not doing it at all. So basically what I am saying is that when life gets challenging I face the challenge and hope for the best outcomes. I know somethings aren’t in my hands but try doing the things that I can be responsible for. Also when life gets challenging I need to get of my stress so I try to divert my mind from the problem for a while and come back to it with a more focused self. If life gets super challenging I eat ice cream and binge watch my favorite show to make me realize that facing the challenge is better then sitting around doing nothing.

I tend to get stressed out easier than most of my friends/peers do, so I have had to come up with different methods to relieve my stress.  I’ve found that talking about things with others, rather than keeping my worries to myself helps relieve stress I have.  I also go running when I feel stressed out to clear my mind, and in a way relax.  I try to stay as positive as I can when life gets challenging, although it is very difficult to do so.  I make sure to remind myself that although my life might be challenging at the moment, as time goes by I will be able to overcome the challenges I face and be happier. "

2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,758,"When life is getting challenging i usually tend to try to adjust to what the situation is. I also realized that taking a step back is good in order to take a breather and also take more control of the situation. Lately I’ve been Stressed with school the most because I’m at the point where I’m taking all my major classes. THey’ve been hard but when I’m stressed w/ school related stuff i tend to dive into it more, for example go to the library more often and study for my classes. This helps because it ensures i put all the effort into it. When other stuff outside of school stresses me, I honestly just try to deal with the situation instead of trying to avoid it, this has helped me because back in the day i used to try to avoid the stress but then it would just result in me being equally stressed or being stressed even more than before. Curr3ntly I’m stressed about the coronavirus situation and then having to deal with a different class format. But I have to say, for some of my classes the zoom is actually enhancing my learning because i can rewatch them and make my notes even better."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,754,"Reflection Essay 2Russell WongSci-0333-02“What do I do when life gets challenging” I do a abundance of things when life gets challenging especially for school related topics and agendas that I need to follow. I often don’t have challenging situations unless it is due to a limited time period and my schedule won’t allow much time to be used is a start. But when my life does gets challenging I end up facing them head on, of course with precautions and ‘bumpers’ as I like to call them, this consists of repeat attempts on homework to try and grasp the information given to me. I look over or at other peoples experience and guidance, teachers, students, tutors who can either help or relate to me in a given way. Most of the time I don’t do anything immediate, I sit back and analyze, think about what is challenging me the most, develop ways to either solve, improve or test effectively or on rare occasions I will not do anything at all, due to my own natural feelings in which I should not step in and just stand by. I overview as many options as I have and try to use what would be the best outcome no matter how difficult it may be or how easy it may be, I will face it and never run away from it."
