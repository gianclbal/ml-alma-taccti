Over all the main reason why I wante tobe a biology major was because I wanted to extend my science and discover what I was really into. I founf out how i was into biology and every time I did biology I actually felt like I was a litle kid and I was happy doing it. Over all i guess another reason why i wanted to do science was because I was a very curius kid and even now i continue to be curious and keep my mind open about new scientific ideas. Over all I consider myself to be curious and learning new things about my world around me and being able to discover new things every day is what makes me want to be a biology major an do research. I want to be a scientis and get to discover the cure for a genetic disease who knows. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,315,"I want to pursue my major choice because I genuinely enjoy and find the classes extremely interesting. When I started my college career, I did not expect to enjoy my major choice as much as I’ve ended up loving it. Although being a Biology major is extremely challenging, it is super interesting to learn how the world works and the science behind it. I originally chose my current major only because I thought it would get me into medical school. I didn't care what my major was, as long as it was going to look competitive to medical schools. Since I’ve started college, I have actually come to love my major. Not only will it look competitive to medical schools that I end up applying to, but it also really interests me on a personal level. I did not do great in my high school level science classes, so it is crazy to me how much I’m now enjoying them and doing really well in them. These classes can still tend to be extremely challenging, but the passion for the topics keeps me going through the tough times."

I haven't taken my gwar or a UD physio course but I have taken other bio classes for this concentration. figuring out career options and other ideas on what I would want myself doing years from now... this major is a great fit for my career choice and the concentration has a lot of classes would benefit my future learning … which is why I am in the major I am in. the career I wanna pursue is to be an Obgyn or something in the medical field. I also think that I got into my major to be more self aware of how the world works in relation to science and society. I would love to take hed courses but I would have to declare a minor in it to take most of the classes I am interested in. there are obviously so many other ways that I can be active in the society and give back to the community but I choose to get into biology because that Is something I can rely and focus on something that I see an end goal to which is why I choose biology"
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,756,"The reason I want to go into my major is to pursue the dream of becoming a practicing physician. I also really like science so having a little bit of everything in my major is awesome. I am a cell and molec. biology major and I think its the most interesting so far because we get to dip a little deeper molecularly which is awesome. I also am leaning more towards the genetics area of biology because it just amazes me how much genetics can tell you where your from, whos your long lost cousin and even can use your genome to connect and see if you have a cousin that is under investigation, comparing genome and just being able to detect any autosomal diseases or rare diseases before a fetus is born. These are some of the many things that pique my interest in becoming a biologist and pursuing becoming a practicing physician."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,753,"Why do I want to go into my major? I am Bio-Physiology major with a minor in chemistry and a minor in africana studies. I want to go into my major because this way I complete all the prerequisites for medical school in becoming a PA (Physicians Assistant). I believe this is the most efficient way for me to be successful in school while retaining the most information. I was originally a chemistry major but in order for the career path I wanted to take, I basically would have to double major in order to fulfill the prerequisites. By being a Bio-Physiology major it helps reduce the stress load on me but also is setting me up for success in medical school. I also wanted to go into my major to show that black women can be just as successful in STEM as anyone else and I also want tone a role model for younger black women."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,657,"The reason why I chose a STEM related major is because I have been interested in the medical field since I was very young.  Thirty-four years ago, when my mother was 16, she was involved in a car accident and was paralyzed from the waist down.  Growing up I always found joy in helping my mother with whatever she needed, although I did not have to do very much for her because she is very strong and independent.  Going to her doctors appointments with her, and visiting her when she was in the hospital many times exposed me to the medical field at at a very young age.  Watching the nurses and doctors work made me interested in making my career focused around helping people.  I plan to attend medical school after receiving my bachelor in Biology, and become a dermatologist.  But a part of me is also interested in going into spinal research.  I hope when I become a doctor that I can help people to live long and healthy lives like the doctors that have helped my mother.  I believe that all of those involved in STEM are extremely important, great discoveries have been made by previous STEM majors. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,75,"I choose Biology concentrated on Physiology because I want to go to a Medical school to become a dermatologist. I want to become a dermatologist because ever since I was young, I loved taking care of my skin and loved searching for new skincare products. During my puberty, I had very severe acne which caused a lot of acne scars. Because of puberty, I started to learn more about skin cares especially Korean skincare products. I started to learn skincare ingredients and techniques. I love giving skincare advice to my friends and my family. I like to read and watch articles about skincare methods, and skin-related diseases. Another reason why I want to become a dermatologist is that my mother had a skin-related disease and she was healed it takes to dermatologists.

2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,758,"I want to go into my major because I really like science. When i first started school i wasn’t sure what major i wanted but i knew it had to be a science based major. Since forever ago, I’ve been inclined to science. I’m not going to lie science is hard but i noticed that I’ve always liked to study any science topics and i didn’t mind the work. So my sophomore year i decided that i would declare a physio major because i decided that i wanted to go into dentistry and they’re preferred major is physio. So far i am not mad at my decision. It’s so funny because everyone kept telling me that a physio major is hard but i didn’t think so until this year. All my classes are so dense, they’re not hard if you study but it’s definitely very very time consuming. Luckily i have not changed and i still enjoy studying and learning about science. "

I have hope to get into a medical school or some sort of program that would let me gain that experience. Also earlier in my life I’ve realized that I’m more of a hands on learning so the chemistry and biology classes have always caught my attention and would have me most interactive in. As I started to move into the degree I started to realize that I wanted to do more in this field and see what I can do to also help the community.

His doctor told him that they didn’t have a good treatment. Fews moths later my got their visas to travel to the U.S.  In the U.S., the doctor told my dad the doctors in my country misprescribed him the medications and diagnosis to treat the Hepatitis C. I realized that the country I came from didn’t have many good doctors, and most were neglecting their jobs and responsibilities. My dad’s health condition showed me the importance of good and professional medical treatment. It made me want to become a doctor to provide that level of treatment to patients so they would not have the same experience as my dad. I am truly motivated to become a doctor and help patients in my country receive the treatment they deserve.  STEM major will permit me a wide assortment of future openings after graduation. For illustration, seeking after an designing major opens numerous entryways; a graduate can look for a career in such different areas as chemical designing, computer science, or natural science."
