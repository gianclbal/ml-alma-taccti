2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,753,"""Why am I here?""Why am I here? The reason I am here is because I want to be successful and have an impact on everyone's lives. I want to be a Physician Assistant because I want to be able to be a role model for young black girls like myself. I want to walk into the examination room and them be shocked that it is a women who looks like me. Me being here is way more important than that though. I want to maximize my opportunity to get an education as others are not able to get one. I also want to always expand my mind and keep all my options open. Basically, I am here to learn and be the change I want to see. I want to see black women in high positions in the medical field. I want to be able to inspire little girls to always accomplish their dreams. That's why I am here."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,315,"I decided to take this supplemental Sci class for many different reasons. After the first few weeks of my Organic Chemistry class, I already felt like I was falling behind. I hope that this course helps to keep me up to date with the material gone over in class. I also find it very helpful to have my peers explain certain concepts rather than my professor on certain topics. This Sci class will be the perfect opportunity for me to take advantage of that learning style. After just the first class, I just already feel like the instructors gave me a ton of helpful tips to help me to thoroughly understand the concepts. I feel very lucky to have access to this help from my peers and I look forward to challenging myself academically this semester. Hopefully this Sci class helps me get an A in Organic Chemistry!"
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,754,"Reflective Journaling Essay #1Russell WongSci-0333-02Why am I here?Why am I here? Well for one I am here because I needed to take this course in order to “survive” in my current Chem 215 class. By taking this course, it will give me a better understanding over concepts and formulas that I may have or haven’t gone over in my lecture for Chem 215 class. I am also here because it fits my current class schedule, sort of in the middle of it and it is just before the weekend. Which if I know myself well enough, it will allow me procrastinate less on the weekends over homework and study time for Midterms. I am also in this specific Sci-class because one of my friends is in this same class. The friend who encouraged me to take this class when I was debating whether I should do so or not. Well I am here now because of her and because I need to have a better personal understanding in Chemistry because of my major is under the science field. To be more specific it is Biochemistry, which will require me to take other future courses for my major and I want to have a stable ground which I can stand on and build off of its foundation."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,755,"As a junior in college, and also a commuter I do not have free time for study sessions outside classes that actually fit my schedule and I learn better when materials are repeated and bought to knowledge in groups. I chose to take this class because this is a class offering help regarding the subjects I am currently enrolled in. I am here to learn help me better understand the course material and also because I did look into the free tutoring help on campus but since this is a confirmed help session which I get one unit for being enrolled and fulfilling my attendance it was the best fit for my schedule. After this semester started, this class was a little different compared to what I thought this class would be. This class has really helped me because I feel like since the teachers are past students of that class – they help  us to understand the ways of how the class is carried out and also how we are supposed to expect from the class. Today I am here because as a commuter I am not always able to use the campus resources to fit my schedule and since this fits my schedule I am using this class a support class that helps me summarize the materials taught in class in details. Since I know how to these classes work as a STEM major I look forward to taking more of these classes. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,75,"The reason why I am here (SCI  333) is that I want to learn or understand the topics of CHEM 233 Lecture and Lab classes. I am taking chemistry classes because I am majoring in Biology in Physiology as a focus. After attending the San Francisco State University, I will transfer to Medical School because I want to become a dermatologist. I want to transfer to UCSF or the University of Washington as my graduate school. I want to study hard, get a good grade and get in the Medical School that I want to get in. However, most importantly, I want to understand the topics and use them in real life. In SCI 333 class, I want to improve my teamwork skills and communication skill. I want to be a better person than yesterday’s self and improve every day. I want to be a good person, a good student, a good daughter, and a good future doctor."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,657,"I am taking ScI 333 because  I found out about taking sci classes during my second semester of freshman year during a biology course.  I realized by taking the sci class I was able to get more help on understanding the concepts outside of the classroom and office hours.  I hope that in taking this class I will be able to understand the material I may be too timid to ask about in the classroom.   I'm Pretty confident in my skills in chemistry currently, but I hope that by the end of the semester I will gain more confidence and not be afraid to ask questions and make errors.  The reason why I am taking Chemistry 333 in general is because of completing the requirements for my major and hopefully one day in the future, be accepted into a medical school.  I hope to become of some profession in the medical field, but I’m not entirely sure of what I want to be yet, I have most interest in being a dermatologist. This is a class i've been nervous to take to fulfill my degree requirements, but I hope to gain a better understanding of the material as it may help me at some point later in life. "

I am here because I want to be able to take care of myself in the future and not depend on anyone else but myself. I feel that this sci course is also a piece of a boost to secure the future for me and to understand what I'm doing with my life and in a way that it can give me direction on what I want to do, kind of like a compass. I am here because of my parents, I wouldn't have graduated in a 4-year university if it wasn't for my parents, I originally wanted to start off in community college but now I'm glad that I got that little push to be able to say I graduated in collage 4 years straight out of high school and now able to get a career. "

2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,758,"I’m here because I’m taking organic chemistry and I’ve taken Sci classes for other chemistry class and they’re helped so much. I enjoy the chemistry Sci classes because they provide extra help and help me make study groups. I’ve taking Sci classes for math and I didn’t enjoy them at all because they didn’t really provide help. Anyways, I’ve always liked chemistry and I enjoy studying for it but its always a class that you need to put in the work to get good grades. This class is excellent for me because it helps your gpa and helps you with the actual class. Anyways, I hope to get an A in ochem and I’m hoping this class helps me achieve that. So far I got an a in the first test so... so far its looking good. Reaching 150 words is rough so maybe make these little journals a minimum of 100 words. Please."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,759,"The reason that I decided to join the sci supplement course was to try to get a better understanding of the organic course and make sure that I am able to leave with knowledge. In the past sci classes that I’ve taken, helped me understand topics like Chemistry that helped me pass the class with confidence. I was able to learn the topic better and when it was time to go to class, I felt like I knew what the professor was talking about and was able to help my friends that aren’t part of the sci class. So, knowing from past sci classes, I knew that I needed to add this class to make sure that I don’t fall behind and end up getting a bad grade. I tend to learn better when the class sizes are smaller and more interactive compared to the stuffed lecture classes so by working in groups, we can learn from each other. The sci classes give students a chance to get more detailed examples so that the whole class will do it together and that’s how I learn best. I hope to pass chemistry and to really remember the topic with the help of this sci class and those who are part of it."
