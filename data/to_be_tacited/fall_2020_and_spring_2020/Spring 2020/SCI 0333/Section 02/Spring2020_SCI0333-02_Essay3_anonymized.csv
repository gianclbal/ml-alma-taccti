I am second-generation-ish Mexican and I say Ish because my mom was born and raised in Califonia and My dad was born in Mexico and was raised here for most of his life. All of my grandparents are from Mexico and to see that their kids and grandkids are doing something better for their life gives them happiness.

2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,762,"My family values have revolved around respect, kindness, confidence, curiosity and resilience. I turned to these values as I went through high school and they were able to give me motivation to continue my educational path. Now that I am in college I also keep these values close to me. Always remembering that respecting others will give me the respect I deserve. Always being kind to people because you never know when they might need you or when you might need them. Always trying to be confident for example to do well on exams or present which is something I often struggle with because my comfortableness with public speaking is not as good as I would like it to be. Always being curious so it pushes me to ask questions and find answers as well as being able to observe and like science taught me, create a hypothesis. The last one is the one a cherish the most, resilience, because my college life so far hasn’t been the easiest. I have stumbled upon many barriers that sometimes discourage me but thinking about my future and how it will benefit me puts a hard hand on thoughts that guide me to give up. Instead I overcome whatever it is that is affecting me and continue with my college experience because I know life is just barely starting. "

I am a third generation college student so ever since I was little I was encouraged to receive a higher education. Due to this encouragement from my family, it has inspired me to go further than college to receive a doctorate degree.

2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,759,"Coming from a group filled with other college students of the first century, we all tend to receive the most support from the people around us or from our school. I'm one of the first group of college students in my family, but my older siblings have already been through it and are willing to tell me about their experience. They were the ones who helped me pick my classes to making sure I read the paperwork right and they made sure I understood what I was doing while they didn’t have someone at college to teach them. My parents and those around me have also put in my mind the thought of going to college, reminding me that when I am autonomous without a college degree life would be difficult for me. I've always been told about schooling and how necessary it is to go to education, but at the beginning I wasn't equipped to be ready for school when it's time for lessons and FAFSA. Overall, I was loyal to the teachers and my loved ones who told me about the college experience and how important it can be until life arrives."

The values that my family gave from a young age have helped me through my journey in college.  For me, I find comfort in praying and believing that God will allow me to do great things if I do my best, regardless of if I am ridiculed because of it.  Coming from a community as small as mine to a city as large and fast-paced as San Francisco was quite the transition.  I was very homesick during my first year of college, even though I only live an hour away, and to be honest am I am still homesick to this day.  But the values that I learned from my community about finding people that truly care about you, and to spend time with people who make your life filled with more happiness and love, has helped me gain the most genuinely nice people as friends.  My community and my family have definitely had a large impact on how I have made my way through college thus far."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,75,"The values of my community and family have helped me throughout college due to the support they have provided for me since the first day I started freshman semester. I would say that community has been a lot more potent compared to my family aspect because being the first child to attend a college that isn’t community, it was and still is hard to make them understand the things I do since my two elder sisters never did anything like that, they were never active in extracurriculars so they were only used to a lifestyle of working, going to school and going to work. "
