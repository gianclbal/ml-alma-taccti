2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,756,"A concept covered in class is the Newman projections. The question I'm going to formulate is how relevant are Newman projections to the real world. And The way that a molecule is structured has a lot to do with the energy that It gives off and the stability of a molecule. In today's world. If a molecule has bug charged configurations, it could go really bad or really good. If the charged molecules overlap on each other and are not spread out it has a higher chance to be more energetic charged. If the molecule is more spread out then its less likely to be unstable and be lower in energy. This could help scientists determine the maximum and minimum energy of a molecule and determine if that the right amount of energy needed for a reaction."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,657,"A topic we have gone over in lecture the past couple weeks has regarded Sn1,Sn2, and E1& E2 reactions.  Multiple factors come into play to determine which reaction will occur.  These factors include what the alkyl substrate is (&primary, secondary, tertiary carbons) whether there is a poor or good nucleophile, a strong base vs a weak base, and if the base is sterically hindered.  An example of this type of question is, say we had CH3CH2O-_Na+   + (a bulky substrate with a Bromine attached), the reaction that will take place is an Elimination 2 reaction. The reason why is because Ch3CH2O- is a strong base, when this strong base (nuc:) attacks and bonds to a bulky tertiary carbon substrate the only reaction that can occur is an Elimination 2 reaction. From this reaction 3 alkene products will form.  If asked for the rate law for this reaction, it would be rate=k[substrate][base], because this reaction is dependent upon the substrate as well as the base. This information most likely won't be applicable to the average person's everyday life, however for a STEM student this information can be very valuable and helpful.  Elimination reactions are important as a method to synthesize alkenes.   "
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,757,I mean with Ocehm I feel like most stuff do relate to our life. so far i have strugle to really conect Ochem with things we see in our daily life since we havent talk much about how organic compounds I feel like over all its been challenging for me to really have an idea how will all this that I have just learn can conect with the outside world. on another note I am having really a hard time understanding o chem becaouse it's already hard for me and just to see how it can realte to the real world for me is hard. I mean im sure it has to do with chemical structure and how they react in nature suach as the things we ahve learn about haloaklenes in labs settings. Other things that might come to my mind is how maybe organic structures can be made out of simple organic molecules suach as ethenol which is found in beers 
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,75,"SN1 and SN2 are substitution reactions. These reactions are used when we want to replace a group with another group to get the desired product. A hydroxyl group towards an SN2 reaction which allows us then to introduce multiple modifications through a substitution reaction which then allows us, or facilitates the preparation of a variety or library of different compounds which we can then screen for potential activity. Chemical reactions proceed through a variety of mechanisms. One in particular that you see very often is the SN2 mechanism. The SN2 mechanism is easier to understand if you think about it backward. So it's the capitalization of Second-order Nucleophilic Substitution. So a substitution means that one group is replacing another. In our case, in this mechanism, that group is the nucleophile, and what that means is that it uses a lone pair to do the chemistry that actually replaces the leaving group."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,762,"A topic we went over in class was R and S configurations. I had a question about how we can determine the configuration given that the lowest group wasn't facing away from us, but towards us. I was able to look at some notes from lecture but also in this class as well and I understood that we could solve problems like that by flipping the molecule around in our mind. However, I am really not good at visualizing stuff in my mind so this method wasn't helpful for me. Instead I looked at other videos that went over other methods and I learned about an easier way to determine R and S given that situation which was to ignore that the lowest group was facing into us and do the steps as you would normally do and then because of the lowest group is facing us we would give the opposite configuration from what we initially got. For example if we got an R configuration and the lowest group was facing towards us then we would change to the S configuration and vise versa. I'm unsure how this would benefit society, but I think its applicable I guess for people who are going into chem research.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,758,"Something we’ve recently have been talking about is Nucleophilic substitution reaction. My question that I’ve come up with is “what does Nucleophilic substitution consist of?” What we’ve learned about this topic is that it involves a nucleophile, Electrophile and a leaving group. A nucleophile is the one that donates electrons and an electrophile is the one that likes electrons. Note that the carbon is considered the Electrophilic because of the polar bond, the halogen pulls the electron density away from carbon which makes it more positive. The leaving group is the group (an element thats a halogen) that gets replaced or kicked out by the entering nucleophile during this Nucleophilic substitution reaction. An important note you must notice is that a nucleophile with negative charge usually results with a product with a neutral charge. When you react a neutral nucleophile (no visible charge) it tends to result in the product having a positive charge. The basically sums up the reaction and what it consists of."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,753,"What causes molecules to have chirality?In class we went over the idea of chiral centers/chirality. It is usually a tetrahedral carbon attached to four different groups or “substituents”.  For each chiral centre there are two different ways of arranging the 4 different substituents, which gives rise to two different configurations. A chiral object is not identical in all respects (i.e. superimposable) with its mirror image. An achiral object is identical with (superimposable on) its mirror image. Chiral objects have a ""handedness"", for example, golf clubs, scissors, shoes and a corkscrew. Achiral objects do not have a handedness, for example, a baseball bat (no writing or logos on it), a plain round ball, a pencil, a T-shirt and a nail. They are also stereoismoers which are a form of isomerism in which molecules have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms, but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space. The simplest example of geometric isomers are cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene. Enantiomers is each of a pair of molecules that are also mirror images of each other. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another and are non-superimposable on one another to."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,754,"Russell WongSci 333-024/21/20Reflection Essay #4How do you know to tell whether a molecule is R or S? Well to start to answer my own question, you can first identify whether the molecule has four substituents connected to a carbon, each one needs to be different from the other. From there I identified what the substituents were and how big they were. Then I applied whether the substituents had a lot of protons, I also applied the electronegativity by using a periodic table as a reference. After that I made sure to include how to draw them out in a corresponding order of 1 through 4, the biggest being one to have been the best choice and 4 being the worst substituent such as hydrogen. That is how I figured out how to determine R and S.I also kept in mind that R is clockwise direction and S is in counterclockwise direction."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,759,Some of the recent topics that was covered recently in class that I am still out completely sure about is how unimolecular substitution in Sn1 processes. Some of the information that I was able to reteach myself about unimolecular substitutions is how the dissociation of the halogen of the carbon substrate to create a carbon cation with a connected halogen. This step should be the most unfavorable and slowest since its leaving behind a halogen when the carbon cation is created. With the first step being dissociation  a solvent would be added to create a carbon oxygen bond that is positively charged. The first step is usually the loss of the leading group with the carbon cation being created. During the second step the nucleophile targets the electrophile leading to and new elemental bond. With the first step being there slowest step and the second being the fastest depending on the rate of the reaction. For the nucleophile to be able to attack the electrophile the carbon cation needed to be formed first determine the overall rate. Depending on the strictest of the substrate as well can play a role on how fast the mechanism based on the number of carbons connected. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,315,"One concept that we have gone over in ochem is using different methods to separate two solutions. This was mostly covered in our lab portion of this class. In one specific lab, we used a method of separation in order to isolate the caffeine from a teabag. I feel as though this lab was a good representation as to how organic chemistry can apply to people's day to day life. This was also my favorite lab for this reason. I feel as though this could affect people’s day to day lives because it could be used in more ways than just separating two chemical compounds in a lab. I think it would be interesting to know if these methods of separation and isolation could be used on caffeine within other substances such as coffee. I feel as though much more of society would be interested in some of the technicalities behind ochem if they understood that certain aspects of it do apply to their day to day life. Although this concept was mostly only covered in lab, we did go over some of this in our lecture. This is only one example since chemistry makes up so much more of people’s day to day life than they realize."
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,760,"In the past few weeks I learned about S and R configuration. The R / S system is an important nomenclature system for denoting enantiomers. This approach labels each chiral center R or S according to a system by which its substituents are each assigned a priority, according to the priority rules based on atomic number. The key difference between R and S configuration is that the R configuration is the spatial arrangement of R isomer, which has its relative direction of priority order in a clockwise direction whereas S configuration is the spatial arrangement of S isomer that has its relative direction of priority order. Both members of the pair of diastereomers have enantiomers, so they are chiral. It is possible for a diastereomer of a chiral molecule to be achiral, however. This occurs when one diastereomer is a “meso” compound. We can look for a plane of symmetry in the molecule. Imagine this plane as a mirror through the middle of the molecule. If one half of the molecule is reflected into the other half, then the molecule is achiral. If no such mirror plane exist, the molecule is usually chiral. I don't know where these information be useful outside the class room because we. learn about chemistry and do reactions and how to determined molecules. I think this information used to benefit society for those who are expert at chemistry because they might do things to benefit society. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0333,SI,2,755,"Select a concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks, either in lecture or lab, and formulate a question. Then look through your class notes, lab notes, and/or textbook and write an essay in response to your question, summarizing the relevant information. Discuss how this information might be generally applicable to people’s lives and/or how this information might be used to benefit society. Be sure to include some concrete information that was covered this semester, explaining why this specific information is relevant. Be sure to give examples.I am not really sure on how to answer this question but I am assuming that we can say that different ompounds are responsible for the type of product formed. learning about resonance and isomers or the newman projections we understand how compounds react to each other or how stable a certain group of compounds are in a particular situation. we can say that depending on the skeletal structures and the r and s confirmation we can figure out if the hydrocarbon is towards us or away and how that reacts to form different products. an easy example that I keep is the formation of micelles and how that idea has helped people understand the structure of chemical properties specially during this pandemic."
