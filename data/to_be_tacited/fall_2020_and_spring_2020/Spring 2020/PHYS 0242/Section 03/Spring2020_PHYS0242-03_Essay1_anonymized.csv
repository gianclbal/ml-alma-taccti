Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,502,"I am here at SFSU since the curriculum for civil engineering seemed well rounded and comprehensive. I picked engineering since I like the scientific process, working with numbers, and applying knowledge in order to solve problems. Furthermore, I am here in order to improve my ability to work and adapt efficiently to situations and lessons in the classroom. Mainly, I like where I am at since there is a lot of room for me as a student to improve and use logical reasoning in the future. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,503,"I am here in class on a Tuesday afternoon in terms of taking physics 242 because I need it to graduate. This 3 hour class is a prerequisite for engineering classes. Sometimes I think to myself that I don’t need to be here. We the students decide whether to come to class or not. I chose to come to class so that I can learn the material and perhaps not depend on anybody. I want to be successful in life and I want to help people when I make it to the engineering industry. So the first step of achieving that purpose is to actually come to class and pass every class that is required for my electrical engineering degree. It is not easy to obtain this degree, so in order to get this degree I will need to put in hard work. Hard work that will require a lot of energy, such as sleepless nights and lots of studying. In addition, I am here to show myself that anything is possible because physics is not an easy subject. It consists of knowing what physics is and applying it to the real world and knowing what all equations mean. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,504,"Hi,I too ended up at SFSU because I was rejected from a few of the other schools that I applied too. It bothered me at first but it was also nice to see that most of my friends from community college ended up coming here as well. Having that small transfer group actually helped me a lot in my classes this past semester because we’re all engineering majors. Hopefully we will get to graduate at the same time too. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,505,"The reason I’m in this class is to fill my requirement. As a engineer I need this class to get in to my classes. But i really enjoy this class. Our professor makes this class really enjoyable and he’s really helpful. Also i really think physics is really awesome and i really like the labs we do. I’m really excited to the rest of the labs. Maybe i might change my major if like physics a lot. Maybe i don't know. I just hope the lecture and the lab matches. Hopefully we won’t have quizzes because i believe lab should be about experiments and testing about physics. Also I want to help out my classmates anything they need and also to do cool experiments together. I remember my physics class in high school it was really awesome. Learning about gravity and doing all kinds of experiments. But my teacher ruined it all because he didn’t wanna do any labs. I just hope i’ll get a good grade in this class, i know i will because I’ll be working hard trying my best to pass this class. I hope our professor stays this cool and doesn’t change, he's really cool the way he is."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,506,"I am here (San Francisco State) because I finally figured out what my purpose is and what I want to do for the rest of my life. After high school, I was very unsure of what I wanted to study and what career I wanted after that. I began as a history major at Riverside City College, and by the time I arrived at UC Riverside, I was a Spanish major. I was very unhappy with what I was pursuing and became very unmotivated; this led to me dropping out of school. For months I worked random jobs while I searched for something to inspire me. I have always been good with my hands. My father taught me many things about construction while I was growing up. One day, a friend approached me about joining a construction trade. I took the job and as soon as I set foot on my first big construction site, I knew there was something there for me. The first three years I was an apprentice, and I learned a lot about my trade. With a lot of hard work and dedication, I was able to master my craft and was given more responsibilities by my superiors. I was made a foreman and had the responsibility of running a project, along with a crew of carpenters. I became fascinated with managing projects and wanted to learn more about it apart from the blue-collar aspect of the job. I quickly realized that if wanted to do this, I was going to have to return to college. I enrolled and spent one year at a junior college and transferred to SFSU.  I am now on track to earning a bachelor’s in civil engineering. I am here to continue paving the way to a successful and fulfilled future. It definitely is a difficult journey and comes with many challenges, but in the end, I will achieve something that is going to benefit me for the rest of my life."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,507,"I am here at SFSU because I have had a strong connection with San Francisco since I was a little kid. My great grandpa lived on Pacheco ave about 3 blocks away from the beach and it was awesome as a little kid to be able to run to the beach since I grew up in Chico where all we have are lakes. my grandpa passed away when I was in high school so I really wanted to still have a reason to come to San Francisco. I knew I wanted to become a civil engineer out of high school since that was my dads dream and now it is mine. I just love the area and I still have family near by which is nice. Honestly, I have always just been connected to this city. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,508,"“Why am I here?” Is a weird question to me. Like I don’t know there a lot of different reasons why I am here, some that I know about and probably some I don’t know about. The reason I came to SFSU is to finish my degree in Civil Engineering. I’m in Physics 240 and 242 because it’s a requirement for my degree. If we are speaking more broadly though I’m here because of my family pushing me to do better and to make sure that I’m able to provide for myself."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,509,I'm really glad I came to sf state. I wasn't really sure where I wanted to go to college. All i knew was that i wanted to study computer science and electrical engineering. I didnt think it  really mattered where i went to school. I went to a very academic high school and all the students were pressured into trying to get into a UC or ivy league school. I remember the only uc i was actually interested in going to was Davis. I think that was just because of the focus on agriculture. It seemed very rural which would have been a nice change from city life. I was born and raised here in sf. This was one of the reasons i decided to go to sfsu. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,510,"Sorry I came late today and I have a slow computer so this might be a short journal. Honestly I am here because I have to be here. I am a senior. This is my last semester here, And I found out that I needed this course to graduate. I don't know why I did not know that I haven't taken this class. I tried to ask my advisor if I can get excuse from this course. Also this is the only class time that work for my schedule. I remember I did enjoy physics but I was taking my physics course in CCSF and not in SFSU. Its been over 2 years since I took physics so everything is new to me. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,511,I am in this class because it is one of the prerequisites to get into the later classes of engineering. The bigger reason is that this class was one that fit well into my schedule. I am here to learn more about the topic that we see in class but are generally less tangible to let me and others better understand how the processes work in real life or to just experience them. While this is my last strictly physics class much of what I will learn will be needed in the next class
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,512,"Why am I here? I am at sfsu because I wanted to run cross country in college.  While in high school I was deciding between 3 school, but ultimately picked here.  I am on the cross country and track team here at state.  I also wanted to go into civil engineer, and this was the only school with it, the others had mechanical but not civil.  I wanted to go to college around my home, I live about half hour away.  As to why I am currently here in this moment in time of writing this essay thing, I am a third year trying to become a civil engineer.  I also need a fooking hair cut rn.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,513,I am here because I don't know what else id do. I want to make a decent living and without school Id have to do that though something like labor working. There is other ways but I don't know anything about like starting my own business and I don't personally have the capital or credit to be able to venture out on my own so an education will eventually facilitate that. In way like having a sort of credibility or being able to make money to then later fund my dreams. I don't know something like that. I used to be good at math and stuff not so much anymore I'm pretty average at it and thats cool. Not everyone is amazing at everything so I mean I think I'll be able to graduate but if not Ill go work construction or something. But yeah I'm here because I currently don't wanna work construction.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,514,I am presently in Thornton Hall room 116. I walked here from my apartment at University Park North. I am here because I need to take this lab course in conjunction with my physics 240 lecture. I am taking physics 240 because it is necessary for my major which is electrical engineering. I am majoring in electrical engineering because it was either pick a stem major or get disowned and electrical engineering was the stem major that I seemed least repulsive to me. I am at SFSU because I hated the idea of staying in my hometown of San Jose but I also didn't want to move super far away from all my friends who stayed in San Jose for school. Taking this physics course will hopefully instill me with valuable knowledge I can use to be successful in a work environment.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,515,"I’m here because I after 8 years of working towards a music career, I decided I didn’t want a career in music. During this quarter-life crisis, my mom suggested that I look into a career as a mechanical engineer which I promptly laughed off and dismissed. As someone who barely graduated highschool and hadn't taken a math class in 9 years, the thought of going into a field as numerically-intensive as engineering seemed suicidal. However, I started to research what a career in that field actually entailed and ultimately decided that I would go for it. I applied for a few schools, and for some reason SF State accepted me, so here I am, in grad-student Leslie’s class. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,516,"The obvious answer on why I'm here is because I need to take a physics lab class for this spring semester. I'm here to learn more about general physics and get a better understanding of how the complex concepts discussed in the lectures in my other class, actually function in real life. To see how energy principles and ideas are applicable in a more tangible sense. I'm here in San Fransisco Stae university and going through the tedious hours in school in a chance to get a bachelor science degree in mechanical engineering. And use it to become a professional mechanical engineer."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,517,"To break my educational experience into parts, after high school I transferred into a community college (De Anza College) and stayed there for 3 years. Successfully, I achieved my AA degree of Science & Liberal Arts. I then transferred into a 4 year university in southern california (California State Los Angeles) and completed 2 years there. Originally, I was planning to get my Bachelor Degree in Mechanical Engineering but some things did not work out so I was forced to academically move back here to NorCal and finish getting my degree here. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,518,"I am at SFSU because I was unhappy at my former university. I previously attended The University of Arizona for two years but was unhappy with how secluded I felt there. Although I had great friends at UofA (and I’m still friends with them today, I have since visited the school since I transferred out), I felt so far away from my parents and felt very constricted to staying in just that one area of Arizona, since I didn’t have a car and things off-campus weren’t easily accessible. I especially felt very alone when my roommate, who had quickly become my best friend, had to leave school midway through the year during my freshman year. After she left I was very depressed and didn’t do very well in some of my classes. At that point, I decided that I wanted to transfer schools back to California, where my parents were, so I could be closer to home. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,519,"Good afternoon, or whatever part of the day you're reading this during, I hope its good.I am here in this class because I want to major in Mechanical Engineering, and this is the last physics class that is required for my prereqs (yay!). I struggle with physics sometimes because most theorems are hard to visualize. I am excited to be learning physics in a lab setting though, hopefully it serves as a better way to conceptualize the things we are lectured about. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,520,"I needed to take this course since my major requires it. It has some fundamental concepts that will further help me understand my other major course. I am not interested in physics and sometimes it is hard for me to grasp the concepts and formulas in class. However, it on the other hand can help me understand the concepts and relate them to my everyday life. Physics can be easy for some people and it doesn’t require any effort of trying to understand it, but obviously I am not one of those people. It would be wonderful if I can learn to love physics after taking his course. I would probably start to relate everything I see with the concepts and formulas I have learned and started to explain to my friends. I heard from my cousin who attended college in China said that they started taking physics class in middle school and the physics class they took at college was at a more advanced level than the one I am taking now. If it were not for my major, I would not take this course since physics has always been the course that I try to avoid."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,521,"I am here because when I applied for transfer, this was the only school I got accepted to. I decided to still transfer despite sfsu not being my first choice. Other than that, I am here because I want to get a good education in engineering and I believe that that is possible with diligent work. I'm also here because I've decided to stay here when I could have gone back to my homework of San Diego and possibly apply for transfer somewhere closer to home. I don't regret any of those decisions since I'm doing the best that I can while trying to make the most out of the experience of being up here in an engineering program. I am in this physics class because I have to be. This is a pre-requisite for other upper division classes that I must take to complete my coursework at sfsu. I think overall, those are the reasons that I am here. I would say that careful consideration also went into those decisions. I am here because I want to be here."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,522,"Why am I here? I feel like that is something that we ask ourselves everyday, whether it be when were just waiting for lecture to end, or are having an existential crisis, its a question that pops up all the time. For me, I would say that I am here in lab tonight because I am working towards a Mechanical Engineering degree and this was a mandated course. That being said, I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe that this is where I should be. I can't say why I believe this is where I am supposed to be, all I know is that I am not anxious when I am at school, and it is because I feel like I am progressing. When I was younger I would skip class often, and I would always feel terrible. So clearly, wherever/whatever I was going/doing is not where I was supposed to be. So I am here because I want to be, and also because being here does not make me anxious, it makes me happy that I have mentors/friends I look forward to seeing everyday here at SFSU!- Christian Avila-Escobar (ID 915841126)"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,523,"I am here because I have changed what I wanted to study at school about 4 times without being certain whether I would like it or not. I am here because I have finally made up my mind. I believe that this physics course drastically contributes to my knowledge of physics, which I will apply in my engineering career. I am here to absorb new material, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes. I am here to make new connections with people I work with, which contributes to my personal and career growth. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,524,"I am physically here because sf state was one of the few schools that were not too far from home, but far enough and had an electrical engineering program. I also liked the Bay Area and thought I could find more of my interests here. Being here I feel like I should start becoming more involved in my major and clubs but feel I’m not ready yet because of how little background I have but obviously everyone has to start somewhere. I’m here in this classroom because it is required if I want to pass this class with a good grade. I personally do not like labs which I thought was because of the length but I find that I usually go into lab very confused with the instructions and not really understanding why I’m recording measurements. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,525,"I am here because of my mom's courage and I look forward to embrace her courage and bravery of coming to this country. That's why I am here at SFSU with the goal of pursuing my B.S in Civil Engineering. I came to SFSU not by choice really, after multiple college rejections... SFSU was the only State University that provided me with the most financial aid and the closest home. At first I genuinely felt like I am going nowhere because I was not able to go to the school a really wanted to. After my first year in SFSU I embraced living in San Francisco and specially studying in this university. I like the multicultural range from food to peers that lives in SFSU. I also love being here in San Francisco as of right now if the center of all new and upcoming Civil Engineering positions and projects. I am happy to be part of this university as well as this city. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,526,I am at San Francisco State because it was my second choice school and the first choice didn't work out. This school is also pretty good to transfers and accepts your application without too much hassle. I am in this class because it is a requirement and prerequisite to future classes and also because I need to know these things for the future. I am in this specific lab because my schedule got screwed up. I was on academic probation last semester and didn't know about the hold that was keeping me from adding classes to this semester so I had a late start with the classes I wanted. Also all the other sections for this class I have conflicts so it wouldn't work out. I actually have to take something over the summer to make up for a class I couldn't add. I technically could have added the class but it was an 8am class and I commute from Alameda and I'm not the kind of person who could function on less sleep.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,527,The reason I am here is because this is one of the school’s that accepted me and it was more economically convenient to come to this school. The reason I am enrolled in this class is because it’s a pre-requirement for my major. This lab section was also the one that fit most well into my schedule. Another reason I am here is to one day hopefully graduate and make my parents proud. I would be the first person to graduate from college so it will mean a lot to them when I do graduate. My major is astrophysics and the reason I chose that major is because astronomy is only offered as a minor so astrophysics was the closest major to that.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,528,"I am here because I enjoy studying astronomy and physics. This lab class is a required course for a major in astrophysics, which I am pursuing. It is also useful as it serves as a hands-on experience for proving what we learn in class and an introduction to proper research, a career I also plan on pursuing. I have always been interested in astronomy, physics, and math, and being able to study those topics so I can apply what I learn later in life appeals to me. This class gives me a chance to refine what I am currently learning and helps me visually understand many of the concepts that may be more difficult to comprehend."
