2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,515,"I don't attribute my ability to navigate through college to any values of my community or family. I attribute 100% of my ability to navigate through college life to my time spent working the shitty jobs where I was viewed as inferior simply because of my job title, and remembering how much I hated my life during that period of time. College was my escape from that life, and all I need to motivate myself to push through when the amount of work I have to do feels overwhelming is to remember how unhappy I was slogging through life making minimum wage and taking verbal abuse from wretched customers who seemed to enjoy nothing more than feigning superiority over those less fortunate than they are. My one regret is that I can't rub my newfound success as a Project Engineer / Project Manager in their smug fucking faces. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,523,"Values my parents taught me helped me navigate through college and life in many ways. Some of the things I learned from the household I grew up in are diligence, giving your best effort, and taking responsibility for your actions. To begin with, my parent taught me that without hard work one will not achieve what he wants. Many people believe in God and pray, but no matter how hard you pray if you do not get off the couch and start doing what you have to do there is a very little chance you achieve your goal. Second, giving my best effort to everything I do brings me joy. Many people are afraid of hard work, afraid of owning a situation, and afraid of taking responsibility for those actions. They say that actual leaders are not going for a result but they are obsessed with a process. Whether it is working out, studying hard at school, or crushing it at work, if one loves to do the work this love will take him a long way. With that comes the responsibility of owning what you have done. Not only good but bad things too. Most of us do not like to own up to our faults but something I was thought at home was being responsible. If you do it wrong own up to it. It shows people you are not afraid of saying you are wrong and that you understand no one can always be right. These personal qualities and values have helped me come from a developing country thousands of miles away, find friends, and make friendships that can last a lifetime. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,516,"I think one of the core ideas from my family that, I think, helps navigate college is from my Dad. My Dad would always tell me to be confident, not in a typical way, but confident in being able to take chances to become better or improve. Which has helped me feel less stressed in trying to keep up with Classes. This is because unlike in high school which is essentially free, there is an extra layer of pressure separate from needing to do well in class to get good grades, but to also really take the most advantage of my time in college. Since that is significantly more valuable and would feel extra wasteful if I do horrible in my classes. But with that confidence that I’m always in some way improving, it motivates me to not give up and see every class, even if it may not seem important as something that is helping me move forward."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,527,The values of my family have helped me navigate through college. They’ve always supported me with whatever I want to do and this includes graduating from college. They’ve financially and emotionally supported me even when life got hard. My parents have always wanted me to have a brighter future than them. Ever since I was little they have told me that and have given me all the resources available to make that happen. My friends have motivated me through college because some of them also go to college. Most of my friends also come from the same background as me. We’re the first people in our families to go to college so we’re going through a similar experience. Whenever I feel like giving up I look at them and think if they can do it then I can do it too.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,522,"The values of my immediate and extended family have really helped me navigate through college in a way that they have had my back through the entire process. Maybe not always financially (and that is obviously 100% ok) but absolutely in every other possible way. The Hispanic/Latinx community has also been a source of inspiration as it is great to see people who come from the same or similar roots succeed in the many different disciplines they have chosen. College can be fun, but it can also be incredibly tough and stressful at times, so I am thankful that I have had great examples of perseverance, loyalty, and success through both sources. It is important to have these because it takes away a large amount of excuses that one might make for oneself when going through it. Lastly, it also makes me thankful that SFSU has a strong multicultural environment."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,514,"My family values hard work and self-discipline. I think these values in particular have been helpful to me in navigating through college. I have to work as hard as I can because there's always someone who will be willing to work harder. Self-discipline is important in all parts of life. In college, without self-discipline it would be far too easy to lose control of yourself and make decisions you would end up regretting later in life."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,512,"i live at home, so my living situation didn't change from high school to college.  i still have the same habits, both good and bad.  i try to proritise school work first, then running, then making myself a better person, then friends and games.  most days im on campus for 8 hours, from 10-6.  i try to spend 2 hours at school on homework and studying, that way when i get home i have little school work to do.  i usually set a day to do all of one topic, example Monday/Wednesday is math, Tuesday is physics, Thursday is engineering, and Friday is history.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,506,"From a very young age, I became very well aware that education was held to a high regard in my family. My parents always talked about taking advantage of my resources and wanted me to have what they were not able get while they were young. My parents did not have opportunities like the ones I had growing up, but they worked very hard to make sure they I did. They instilled a good work ethic in me so that I wouldn’t become lazy and miss out on a great education. By observing how hard my parents worked and seeing the difficult situations they dealt with, I have become motivated and inspired to be the best student that I can be. I utilize this work ethic to help me get ahead and to ensure that I one day will graduate college. My parents have always told me that each generation in our family should continuously progress and I feel that it is my duty to live up to that.   "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,521,"I started my higher education in San Diego at local community colleges. At first I had strong confidence in what I wanted to pursue, and that continued for a year or so, but after that time I felt as though things were too difficult for me to move forward in my field of engineering. At this time, I also found other things that interested me as well, but nothing to the point of making a career out of it. I felt like things were hard and that I was slowing down in pursuing higher education, but my family really helped put things into perspective, and it also helped that they are very supportive of me in general. My parents are both college graduates in professional jobs, and my father is an engineer at Qualcomm, so I was always exposed to his passion and work ethic. A lot of things led to my decision in continuing my education in mechanical engineering, but I would say the most important thing was that  wanted to make a difference somehow, and my biggest interests fall in the engineering world.My family is a big inspiration to me, and their work ethic helps keep me in check in times when I doubt myself."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,520,"I would say perseverance and curiosity helped me navigate through college. I grew up having a lot of curiosity, and I really appreciate my dad whenever questions arrived at the dinner table, he didn’t try to ignore my naive questions at the time. This act unintentionally encourages me and tells me that it’s good to question and bring it up if anything confuses me. I remember as a kid I would read books that answered questions about nature. It is easy to give up once when we encounter challenges. However, what I have learned is to finish what I started. Being able to appreciate the things I have helps me to go through college. It is necessary to look back and realize how far I have gotten and be grateful for the things I have. My family is always there to support me once I need their emotional support."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,524,The values of my dad greatly influenced how i think of school. Ever since I was little my dad would gear us towards education making us do grade-level appropriate workbooks over summer. When I was 6 years old my dad graduated with his PHD in criminal justice and went on to become a professor. He of course encouraged us to find a subject we like so we can think of what we'd like to major in. And because of that I always realized I was interested in science and pretty average at math so I knew that whatever I want to major in has to be a combination of the two. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,519,"My parents moved to the US from Bulgaria with me when I was 6 years old, with the intention to create a more opportunistic life for us. They haven't since let me live it down. Their sacrifices guilt me (in the best way) into trying my best in everything I do. It serves as motivation to make something of myself and give the move a greater worth. It wasn't easy for my parents to move to a new country where they didn't know anyone and barely spoke the language and didn't have any family in. They've managed to create a life for themselves and I'm trying to follow in their footsteps. It shaped me to be a lot more self-reliant than I would have been if we never moved away from family. Knowing that I'm here and not back in Bulgaria with my family pushes me to better myself and to have something to make my family back at home proud. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,507,"Growing up, not a lot of people in my family attended college. they all went to Sierra Pacific and started working 40+ hour weeks. My dad was didn't know a lot about college because my grandma didn't attend either. My dad wanted to be an engineer but without guidance he wasn't able to fulfill that dream. He was my first stepping stone towards becoming an engineer. He is math teacher now and a 5 year head baseball coach at a Simpson University. With him around teaching me as a young boy I got the feeling and understanding of math quicker than others in my class. He helped me grow my interests and pursue engineering. He was one of the many teachers in high school that helped me develop a love and curiosity for science and math. Eventhough my dads life is working out great, I am still here to finish in my dads footsteps and become an engineer."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,510,"Hard-work, I think my family has valves of hard work. I think our family understands that nothing in life comes easy. You must work hard to be successful in life. During my time in SFSU, I have spent countless hours, days at the library in order to get that extra study in, extra time in for project. I did notice while other student would call in quits at the library, I would stay a bit longer or come in a bit earlier. No one wants to do that, but I think it is truly helpful. My grades can be a testimony of that. However, I also understand the challenge that many student faces. I am lucky enough to live close before and have food to eat. During this difficult time, COVID-19, my hard-work has been lacking. It been more challenging to find space, time to put that extra effort in. I now have more empathy for those student that had a tough time without the covid-19. I am sure I can get through this but it has been definitely eye opening to see how I perform in more challenging time. I know I can bring my grade back up but it would have to take a little more time. Unfortunately this is something I do have. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,511,the values of my community do not effect my decision in academics usually because I try and do what is best for me if I know what needs to be done but if it involves the community i will try and figure out what needs to be done ad do it for my community. The values of my family just help me not give up because they always push through and get the best results that they can get at the time.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,526,"My family isn't very big like some can be. The family i've adopted over the years are more important than some I am blood related to. One thing I learned that I find to be quite useful and that I value is to be professional but also give people the respect you feel they deserve rather than that of a status. This has especially helped me filter out the teachers, faculty, staff or students that I feel are worthy my time. I do not care to interact with incompetent people, but I believe I can see the difference between incompetence and someone who just lacks some skills. This is probably not a big thing for others, but for me, this is the difference between someone I would like to connect with either as a friend or mentor, or someone I will just be friendly too because of curtesy. My personality isn't the most outgoing so finding these key people have been the key to success for me. They have been my support and peers over the years and I am grateful for that."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,517,"One of the biggest inspirations that helped me through college life is my dad. He graduated in University of Illinois and majored in Electrical Engineering. He has inspired me to get into engineering and to push as hard as I can through all my classes in high school and in university. It also helps having other classmates and friends who influenced me in a positive matter, staying on track with all my assignments and studies, to push to get that A grade. I would say that I am very thankful for all that my friends, classmates, and my family who have steered my in the right path for education and help me push towards my end goal, and that is to get my bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering. I am going to try my best to do the best I can now, especially in these hard times with the coronavirus going around, to still stay on track with all my classes (at home) and to keep in focus, as hard as it is. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,503,"My family comes from Mexico. My parents came to this country in order for a better life, the American dream. Mexico is a very poor country, there’s places in Mexico that are style ranch. My moms from a ranch and so is my dad, where there isn’t anything. Now a days, reservation of service in electronics is very hard to reach due to the fact that it’s a ranch. Don’t get me wrong there’s beautiful places out there but I would rather much live out here in the United States. Luckily my parents are citizens of the United States and my siblings and I were born and raised here in the United States. With that being said, the values of my family helped me navigate through college in such a way that neither of my parents went to college. My parents only went to the 6th grade in Mexico. I am a first generation college student, and I am proud of how far I have came. I want to be a role model for my sisters so that they can go to college as well and be someone in life so that we don’t struggle just like our parents. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,508,"I would say the values of my family have helped me navigate through college by just give me sort of a guideline of how to conduct and present myself to others. For example, I was always taught by my mom and aunts to always work hard for the things that you want to accomplish in life. I have kind of always went back to this when I'm either struggling to find motivation when trying to get homework done or studying for exams. Another thing is that I was always taught to respects those around me, so I kind of try to keep that in mind when working in groups for different projects or just generally just trying to respect my professors by trying to keep my work orderly and getting things to them in a punctual manner. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,513,Growing up I the values of family were and still are very important. I was born into a home where we lived with a couple of my aunts and uncles and still am very close to all of them. With both my parents having large families it kind of made things harder. I know I need to focus on me but its very hard because even though they don't ask me I feel the need to be there for all of them and all the events the family is involved in. So even though I'm doing it for me I want my family to be proud because I really wouldn't be here without their support I wouldn't be where or who I am. So overall it has given me a support system a lot of people don't have and im lucky for that but it has also it makes it hard to focus on just one thing.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,525,"I come from a Latino community and family who I will describe as resilient and hard-working. Specially my family, who have overcame the hardest economic and relationship struggles that some people may have not been able to deal with if my family did not have that mentality and values that were brought throughout their origins. This is what was a clear example for me to not limit myself in life and always go through with whatever challenges I will like to work against. For this reason I decided to leave my mother and sister in Spain to pursue a higher education at SFSU by myself. Their instilled values lead me to choose my career in Engineering and navigate through college. I believe if I didn’t have that example from my family that everything is possible if you work hard for it, I would not be where I am today."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,504,"Growing up in my household one value I can think of that helped me through college was to never give up. Throughout my time as a student, school was never too hard for me. It wasn't until college where I started to actually struggle. I was not used to taking tests and not always being able to pass with flying colors. At first I thought I was the only one but then realized that there were many others like me. When actually being faced with a challenge I found that I actually learned and retained way more information than things that came easy to me. Not to mention that it was a little more rewarding. Sure, I could have given up and accepted that I may fail a class or two, but working through the struggles helped me understand the kind of student I am. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,509,"I think I'm lucky to have grown up in a family that valued health and family over school, education, or money. My parents were never that strict when it came to my grades, ""as long as I tried my best."" I think this has helped me a lot throughout college and even high school. A lot of people have their self-worth tied to their intellect, like they do with their appearance. They put a lot of pressure on themselves to be ""smart."" Then when they don't do well they feel angry with themselves. I know I've felt this way too, to a certain extent. It's just upsetting when people don't realize how valuable they are, no matter what grades they get. However, hard work and determination is also a great skill to have. I grew up around people who had fairly strict parents when it came to grades. Then I went to a very academic high school where everyone was just focused on getting into college.  I think growing up around this helped me learn how to do well in classes, which of course has come in handy in college."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,528,My friends and family have taught me a lot that has helped me throughout college. My parents taught me to be responsible and do my work on time. They also taught me to make sure that my work is reflective of my capabilities and to work as hard as a can to achieve academic success. My friends taught me to manage my time between work and relaxation. They taught me the importance of having fun and sitting back to avoid the stress that can negatively impact my efforts in school and life. They also taught me how to find a hobby I enjoy and work at it to develop my passion.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,505,Since I grew up with my parents I have never forgot where I came from. Growing without parents have taught me how to be a strong person. I always taught about making my parents proud and never making them sad. I always have made my parents proud by going to 4 year college and always staying top of my classes. My culture and my religion played a big role on this too. My culture made me who I am. Never forgetting about where I came from and always remembering the purpose of my life. Turkish musics always motivated me during homework always kept me going to far places. My religion has always stopped me from doing bad things. Always taught me to be mind to people and respect. I believe no one should ever forget about where they came from and always have a goal in life. Without a goal your not nothing. If you dont set goals to reach you will go no where. In life I always set goal and always reached my goals. Now i have new goals to open my business and and graduate. I know my religon and my culture will make that happen and I’ll always make my parents proud.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,518,"I think that the values of my family have almost directed me on which ways to go in college. Both of my parents are engineers, and they both grew up in poverty. They worked very hard to get themselves out of poverty (and in my mother's case, into the US as well) and into great careers. They both have incredible determination and drive, and have instilled that into me since I was born. They always encourage me to work my hardest and do my best, because they don't want my life to be anything like either of theirs. While I am fairly independent in most forms, they still help me out financially with tuition and rent because they don't want me to be indebted like they were in their early lives. This helps me immensely in college and afterwards, as I will be able to graduate debt free; a leg above a lot of college students. Their chosen career paths have also driven me to become an engineer as well, so that I can do well for myself as they did."
