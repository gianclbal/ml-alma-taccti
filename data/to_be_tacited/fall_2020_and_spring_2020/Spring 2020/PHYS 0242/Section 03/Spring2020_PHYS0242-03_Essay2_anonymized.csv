2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,527,"My question is why there’s three ways of measuring temperature. There’s Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. Celsius goes from 0 to 100. Zero is freezing point while 100 is boiling point of water. Kelvin begins with 273.15 which is equilibrium between liquid, solid and gaseous phase of water. You then add Celsius to it. For Fahrenheit, 32 is freezing point while 212 is boiling point of water."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,522,"One of the most interesting topics (to me) we have covered in class this semester in Physics III has to do with internal energy of a system and specific heat. I find that it is interesting because it is something that can be thought about in application to a wide variety of everyday activities. For example, we know that Cold = -Heat, what this means is that there is NO cold, just ""less heat"" and this is one of those things I think about on the train whenever I put my arm on  a cold armrest. Sounds random, but I think its interesting how I think about things like this out of the blue, whereas previously I might have just brushed it off and not given it a second thought. Another thing that I thought was interesting that in a way relates to what I previously wrote was the concept of specific heat. By this I mean that the idea that different materials will have a different ""resistance"" value. So that is a concept that I think about nowadays whenever looking at equipment (like BART track equipment or cranes you see by the Port of Oakland) I now wonder WHY they picked a certain metal. Obviously you think about strength or rigidity, but I am sure that the engineer behind those decisions took heat transfer into consideration. Maybe not though, heat generated could be negligible, either way I think its important to ponder these questions as it helps develop some familiarity with the subject and could help make connections when applying it to academic coursework."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,510,"First off, I want to say thanks for understading when I turn last week assignment couple minutes late. I totally got lost track of time and forgot that I had to turn in the lab report before 12:30pm. I am excited to graduate, I been a long 6-7 years of school. I first started at CCSF, did not do great. I had a GPA of 2.5 at my lowest. Definitely got a wake up call when I tried to transfer as a Mechanical Engineer and no school accepted me. So for the next year at CCSF, I manage to get a 2.9 GPA and still no school accepted me so I just attend SFSU. This is my final semester here and currently with a 3.83 GPA at SFSU , and a cumulative of 3.3. My last semester hard has probably been to hardest since I lost a lot of drive and motivation. I know I need to switch gear and jump back into since this is not the end. A new chapter awaits, the real world. I build up my resume and apply for jobs. I don't know what field I want to get into so I'm just hoping to get into anything at the moment. However, I do want a job that care about their grow of the employee instead of just some human engineering machine. I actually won't mind working for a city job since I heard that the benefits are great. For adults like me, I need to care about that more. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,502,"Over the course of class, I have become more familiar with the concepts and principles of liquids and their related physical properties. This is to the extent that I have more avenues of thought in order to solve questions that I face in a day to day setting. This can range from saying “which nozzle do I need to put onto my hose for maximum pressure output?” to “why does the sink work the way it does?” These types of dilema can be answered by applying and understanding terms and definitions of physical fluid interactions like laminar and turbulent flow. Furthermore, I am always applying methods of numerical analysis in a day to day setting with discipline of time management. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,506,"In class, we have been learning about the transfer of heat. There are three different types which are conduction, convection, and radiation. I always associated radiation with harmful rays, but learning about this topic learned that it is how heat is dissipated into an area which makes a lot of sense. An example of this could be the heat that a campfire emits. We focused one lecture on learning about conduction.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,507,"Why is Physics important to learn? I think Physics is really important because it not only helps us learn about scientific meanings of force and velocity etc. , but also helps us understand daily life. From the very first Physics class we talk about forces and Newtons 3 laws and how they effect every day objects but there is more that meets the eye, especially in the eyes of an engineer. For instance, when you pull up to a stop light most people just countdown the seconds until we can go, but for me I think of how the system works. I think of the patterns of the lights, but it gets even better. I think of the forces and the moments and the torques being applied to the huge 50 foot poles and the weight on top of them. My dad is a baseball coach and he asked me how deep we need to dig the poles for a batting cage. I told him the deeper is better because the deeper you go the more pressure the dirt puts on the pole. He ended up getting some pre-made cement anchors to hold the poles down. Physics is everywhere and everything and if we look a little deeper we can see it.   "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,517,"In my lecture PHYS 240 class, one of the things I learned about is heat and the different forms of energy that come with heat. My lecture discussed how heat emanates out of engines and I found that interesting because personally I am into cars. So when the professor discussed something that is car related, in this case, heat and engine, I found it interesting. One of the formulas that is somewhat relatable to heat is the energy equation, which is Delta U = Q - W. ""U"" being the total internal energy, ""Q"" being the heat, and ""W"" being the work done to the system. With the concept of heat and the formulas related to it, this now brings me a better understanding of how heat transfer works with automobile engines. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,516,"One recent topic that I feel could be useful for applying in my life is different materials affect heat. This based on a recent lecture on heat transfer, or convection. Heat transfer can be transferred differently by liquid or solids. In fact there are some instances where air is a better insulator than wood or stone, depending on the temperture. Understanding conviction can help me cook better, knowing water can be affected by the temperture of the pot or of the ingredients. Convection  would probably be useful in choosing the right clothing for winter weather."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,509,In class we learned about water pressure and the area of a pipe or hose. I had been wondering how you determine the water pressure in the piping of a house. I remember helping my dad with some water pipes a few years ago and it can get kind of complicated. There are a lot of turns/corners. Also is the water pressure different depending on what floor of the house you are in. How do you make sure that there is enough pressure. Is there ever too much pressure. Does it all depend on the area/circumference of the tap you use? What kind of calculations do you need to do (if any) to find the water pressure of a specific faucet
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,513,I was not prepared for this question and am after reading it a couple times am just starting to understand it. However I know i need to start writing as to fill the length requirement. It is difficult to formulate what I want to say and write. The question; How does Thermodynamics apply to real world applications when most equations assume ideal gases and fluids? The answer to that is that there are corrections you can make to the equations so that you can use them for real world applications. These corrections would allow many other fields to use equations in practice with different gases and fluids for whatever application they needed them for. In my own live this information could be useful for whenever I am tested on the topic in a class. Currently that is the only situation in which I would use this information as I don't have any knowledge of what I will be doing in the future or how this will help me later on. It would be cool to have a career where it would be useful but not sure if I will be able to. Hey just came back to add at least 8 words to reach at least 200 words.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,508,"Why is light refracted? The reason that light is refracted it because when light travels at an angle into a substance with a different refractive index it causes the light's speed to change. This is why when white light travels through air and hits a glass prism it refracts the different colors of the visible light spectrum. I'm not exactly sure how this is necessarily useful in my everyday life, but I guess it is relevant because it explains things like how rainbows are formed. I don't really have too much to say on the subject, so I guess that is all for now folks."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,514,"In class we went over the subject of pressure in fluids. Pascal’s principle states that in a uniform fluid, pressure increases linearly with depth and also changes in pressure applied to a fluid are transmitted undiminished to every point of the fluid and to the walls of the container enclosing the fluid. This information about pressure could be useful in my own life. For example if I wanted to go hiking up a mountain or somewhere where the elevation is much different from where I currently am, I can expect the pressure in my water bottle to change as my elevation does. Since I know that pressure changes linearly with depth, I will be prepared to deal with the pressure changes of my water bottle when I open it at a higher elevation and avoid getting splashed by my water. This is important because being cold and wet on a mountain can be dangerous and potentially induce hypothermia, especially if I am in a snowy environment."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,512,"Heat. Something about heat. We learned about the different types of heat transfer in lecture.  There's convection, conversation, and radiation.  When you put a cold iron rod into a flame, over time the whole rod will become hot because of conversation, right?  This applies to me because I want to be a civil engineer focused on structures.  When building bridges, metal is placed between concrete, whatever the road is made out of, because the sun heats up the ground.  Without the metal, the road would expand and crack.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,519,"Where can Bernoulli's principle be applied in nature?Bernoulli's principle is a principle in fluid dynamics that states that an increase in the speed of a fluid is correlated to a decrease of the fluid's potential energy. This makes sense, because as a fluid is increasing in speed, the potential energy it carries gets translated into kinetic energy, relating back to the conservation of mechanical energy theorem. Applying this principle to nature, I think of the flow of water down a waterfall. As the water flows down the waterfall, its kinetic energy is increasing and at the same time the potential energy it has minimizes as it's route shortens. Furthermore, as the potential energy decreases, the second part of Bernoulli's principle states that the static pressure of the fluid decreases as well. This makes sense imagining a waterfall because the pressure of the water at the top of the fall would be less than the pressure at the bottom, due to the alleviation of the ""push"" of gravity, forcing the water's fall and increasing its kinetic energy. As the water gets closer to the bottom of the fall, the kinetic energy has increased significantly from the top of the fall, and that push or pressure isn't as intense as it was at the top."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,524,"Last week in lab we did an experiment on heat capacity. And my question is why does heat capacity vary from one material to another material? In lecture the professor was discussing how certain materials hold heat better than others because it has to do with molecules of the material. Some materials have looser/stronger bonds, electron flow is easier/harder, and the collisions of the molecules are all variables when trying to analyze the heat capacitance of a material. This information is useful to me because if I ever need to construct something that involves some type of change in temperature and can decide what material I should use partially based on the heat capacitance. This is how I know it is safer for me to use a cooking utensil with a plastic handle compared to a metal handle. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,504,In class one thing we learned that I found interesting was how temperature and pressure are related to each other. This particularly stood out to me because I immediately thought of a cars wheel and its tire pressure. Many of my friends like to go to the track with their cars and having the right tire pressure can make all the difference in a better lap time. Higher temp = higher pressure in the wheel. When on the track there’s a certain range of psi drivers want to keep their tires around.(Also depends on how they drive) Too much pressure means less grip and too little pressure will ultimately slow the car down. 
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,525,"Why does pressure reduce when a hose is placed higher in altitude but it increases when height lowers?As we experimented in Lab 1, according to Bernoulli's law pressure shall remain constant along a given streamline. Meaning that at a higher point, the pressure shall reduce in order to keep the remaining components of Bernoulli's equation constant. In our experiment, we observed how the water went further away as water pressure was increased and the water volume started reducing. This experiment, can closely relate how height affects the pressure of water in a streamline. In engineering, when constructing a water pipeline for a building, we shall consider this close relation between Bernoulli's law and water pressure. As we go beyond physics, this will help me design a proper water motor that will provide enough pressure to the whole building and allow people get water through their pipeline. I believe this concept of Bernoulli's law is useful when considering the application it has in everyday life, from housing water pumps, to building's pipelines, factories pump supply for a given fluid, etc. This short but simple lab showed us how also the fluid and ""theoretical"" values might result in wrong conclusions. Given that along the years as an engineering you will have access to proper and improved ...."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,521,"A recent concept covered in lecture that I thought was interesting was heat transfer and how that affects a system.This particular concept interests me because it is something that I can see myself using in the future for my career with my hopeful path of going into automotive or aerospace engineering. Either discipline deals with heat transfer and the relationship between how materials deal with energy transfer. Understanding heat transfer can be used to determine the type of materials that are being used like we did in the calorimetry lab previously, and with this knowledge we can understand certain aspects of materials and how they react with their environments. Heat transfer between gases is also interesting because several aspects of gases can be affected such as their volume, temperature, and pressure. These gases can have heat transferred to them, or transfer heat to their environments, but whichever way the flow is directed, the heat energy remains constant. Naturally some energy or heat will be lost to the environment since no container is perfect in preserving such a quantity, and this leads to the problems that engineers face today and continue to improve upon. Many improvements with this concept are observed in the evolution of internal combustion engines which have seen massive improvements in efficiency within the past decade. I would also like to contribute to these improvements if I end up in the automotive field. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,518,"Why do we get so hot when exercising?When I go to the gym, I tend to sweat a lot and exert a lot of energy. This is due to a process called the heat of vaporization, so when I sweat when the heat energy increases the speed of the water molecules so that they can escape into the air. However, sweat usually doesn’t evaporate into the air, it usually rolls down my skin in droplets. Also, not all heat energy produced by my body is lost through sweat. Some is directly radiated from the skin to the air and some is lost through respiratory surfaces of my lungs.Additionally, a major factor into how much I’ll sweat at the gym is the humidity of the air in SF and in the gym. If the air is humid, I will sweat much more than if it’s windy and cold. Also, if the air is humid, then it already has water vapor in it near its saturation point, and cannot take any more. Therefore, sweat does not evaporate and cool your body as efficiently as when the air is dry."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,505,"In physics we have been learning a lot topics. The topics are most amazing subject that we apply in our daily life. The topic that I’ll be talking today is something everyone uses everyday and never realised that physics is involved. In class we done many problems on finding speed, distance and displacement. But I just want to talk about how physics is applied on the car we drive. That’s right, some of us didn’t even know we have been using physics while we are driving our cars. Driving a car uses the basic principles of physics such as acceleration, speed and breaking. How you ever thought about balance of your car? Cars balance changes every time you accelerate, stop and turn. This was basic physics that we didn’t know about. Another example is moving the car. The driver applies these forces in order to move the car on the road. Have you thought about how our cars stop. Yes, we applied the brakes and the car starts to slow down but the realitys is frictions is happening on the brakes. The friction on the brakes and the rotors touching each other helps slow down the car. Another point I want talk to talk about is the stopping distance. For example, a fully loaded truck can stop earlier than a empty truck since the friction on the brakes are increased by the weight of the car. More weight also causes more friction between the tires and the road. In a car crash, such as hitting a tree or a wall will have the greatest force because the kinetic energy and the momentum of you car will be released instantly to the trees and walls are not moving. In a car crash between two cars, the heaviest car will have the least impact because of the kinetic energy and the momentum. There might be a chance the lightest car will l travel in reverse because of the force from the heavy car."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,503,"A topic that we discussed was calorimetry. In calorimetry, a lot of things happen. Why did we use metals in our experiment in lab 9? Throughout this lab, we gathered the weight in kg and perhaps made them really hot and we then used an equation to determine some calculations. I am majoring in electrical engineering, so I will for sure try to use these concepts in the industry. Physics and math will portray back to the industry of engineering because every aspect of physics and math is played in my everyday life. We always need to replicate calculations. In addition, we are talking about radiation in our physics class. This relates to my personal life because I for sure need to learn how to cook. Obviously, if something is very hot my body senses will react to it and will try not to touch it. If I tend to touch something hot then I will burn myself. I for sure don’t want to over cook something and end up burning the food. Not only will the food be burned but the house may be burned down too. I wouldn’t want that to happen because lives matter. Not everyone is perfect but I think that everyone deserve the right to learn how to cook!!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,511,The thermal expansion of solids will be useful to me. The reason is that for engineers we must have basic knowledge of the other types of engineering. If I were to build something out of metal in aplace that can have extreme weather changes it will be useful to know how metal will expand and contract and account for it. Also it order to build something with metal in it that is meant to heat or cool water I would have to know how to design a system that takes into account these changea over years to make an effective system.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,523,"During the first couple of weeks, we covered the idea of the buoyant force in lecture. I have chosen this topic because it is extremely useful in constructing ships, vessels, and any other types of machines that are at sea. My question is: ""How come does a liquid support a body on the surface of the liquid? What forces act on the body and where do they come from?"" Let us use water as our fluid in this question. To begin with, a body is at surface of the water if is it in equilibrium. To reach the equilibrium state several forces should be acting on it. Those forces are force of gravity and buoyant force. Moreover, to keep the body in equilibrium those two forces have to be equal each other but be opposite in direction."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,520,"We were performing a lab regarding the calorimetry last week where heat can influence the object and how certain material doesn’t respond to heat as much as the other object. It relates to everyday uses since it can be our metabolic rates concerning our body temperature. I came to understand how our bodies maintain our temperatures and how the heat can influence that. Also, I understand thermal expansion well when I connect with the tires on a hot day. The hot temperature very likely can influence the size of the tire and help to contribute to the leakage of oil if the tire has higher temperature than usual.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,515,"The thing I'm learning in class right now that pertains most to my future career is communication. The engineering curriculum is extremely taxing, especially when you're working two other jobs, and so communicating with my professors and my peers is essential in order to stay afloat. For example, this week I had an unexpected large project dropped on me at work. I have two midterms coming up, and so I had to make a sacrifice and skip a few classes. By communicating with my professors, I was able to get the due date for an assignment postponed and get help from my classmates in order to study more effectively."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,528,"I want to know how the temperature of an object can be used to determine how it emits various wavelengths of light and how that is useful for astrophysics. According to Wien's displacement law, the temperature of an object and the wavelength of light it emits with the greatest intensity are inversely proportional, and their product is equal to a constant simply called Wien's displacement constant. This law can actually be applied in astrophysics to determine the temperature of a star or other astronomical object by measuring its peak wavelength. As these are properties of thermal radiation, another relevant topic is how the power of this thermal radiation is related to its surface area and temperature."
