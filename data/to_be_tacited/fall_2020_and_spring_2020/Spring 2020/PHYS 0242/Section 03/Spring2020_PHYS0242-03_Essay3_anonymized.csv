2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,506,"This is a circumstance that I have dealt with many times in my adult life. Earlier in my life when I faced a challenging situation, I used to let it stress me out to the point where I would have a complete breakdown. I did not know any other way to handle it. Over time, I realized that I could not let my emotions take control; I was in need of a way to handle this because it was taking a negative impact on me. At first, I seeked help from people who I consider to be really close to me. This helped because I was able to gain an outside perspective and made me see things in a way that I couldn’t come up with. Later on, I tried not to rely too much on others, so I began to write down what was troubling me and I would try to come up with solutions."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,505,"What would I do when life get challenging? That’s a really deep question. I had a lot of moments in life where it was really hard for me. For example growing without my parents. Since 4th grade I started living without my parents. For some family reasons they moved back to Turkey and I stayed here with my uncle and aunt. This was probably be the hardest challenge in my life. It was hard as a kid to get used it. But I held on to life and knew there was a reason behind everything. Always kept myself positive never thought negative. I knew if I led myself down it was going to change my life. This will affect my school and psychology. Never let that happened. Always stayed strong. If my parents saw me in a bad mood, they would have been worse than me since they were not with me, so I never let that happen. Always thought about positive thoughts how I’m going to finish school and go Turkey to see them. This always have worked, now I go to a great school, own what always wanted. Basically I have accomplished by dreams. And there is still more to come."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,512,"when life gets challenging, i usually make a list.  first, i write down everything i have to do, then i go down it and order each task from most important to least important.  but, i only do this about 70 percent of the time.  the only 30 percent i keep pushing off my tasks like they arent there.  this is bad and results with me having a mental breakdown, crying, procrastinating more, and eventually not doing the task or completing it with 50 percent effort.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,519,"When life gets challenging, I sit.I find a quiet place to sit with myself, I turn off my phone and my brain, and I sit with just myself, without the stress of what's happening in my environment and in my head.I do this for at least 5-10 minutes, and come out of it recentered and refocused. There is so much that is constantly happening at all times of the day that it's really easy to sort of let go and be pushed and pulled into the waves of it all. Sitting in silence and sort of muting it all out allows me to come back to the ground and get a better look at the big picture with a fresh perspective. Then when I come back to life's challenges, I can tackle them with a greater strength and figure out what changes I need to make to prevent myself from getting swept up from it all."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,509,"When life gets challenging I usually just like to take a step back and breathe. Right now I'm working on a pretty stressful computer science project. It's due in a week and I have no idea how I'm doing. I have a feeling a lot of people in the class don't know what they're doing. He didn't really teach us what we need to know in order to complete the assignment. However, there are so many people in the class who have done this kind of programming before which makes it a bit more stressful. I feel like the teacher is going to expecting too much from the rest of us. I have to do a ton of online research in order even begin to understand what he wants us to do.  However, I know that whenever I'm stressed or worried about something, I always have my friends to support me. My family is very supportive too. Just knowing that they are there for me no matter what happens takes a lot of the pressure off. It's been hard not being able to see any classmates of friends because of the pandemic, but at least we can talk online."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,504,When life gets challenging I personally try not to stress too much about it. I noticed when I stress too much about something I tend to actually do many times worse than if I calmed myself down before acting. It really helps the situation when I am able to sit back for a little while and work out a solution to solve whatever is bothering me at that moment. Being able to clearly think and decide on the options I have also relieves some of that stress as well. After deciding on what the best plan is I then try to execute it properly until the job is complete.   
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,516,"I feel that when life gets challenging, I usually do one of two things, either feel a little demotivated, or go into a small panic. The panic is because it comes from the fear of failure and potentionaly make the problem worse. However I would then try to focus all my attention to calm down and figure what is the best possible strategy to continue. It's really at most my most dire do I put in the most effort to improve. I know that I always have the chance to improve, and dwelling in the mistakes is not going to help me succeed or be able to become a better person."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,527,"When life gets challenging, the first thing I do is try to clear my mind for a while. Whether I’m stressed about school or personal life problems, I stop whatever I’m doing and distract myself. I take a break and do an activity I enjoy. I will go for a walk at the beach, go to the gym, or listen to music. Once I do that, I usually come back to whatever problem I’m having and see how I can solve it. Another thing I do is think about all the great things that have happened throughout my life and be grateful for them. This usually gives me motivation to keep pushing even during the difficult times in life. If this doesn’t work, then I sometimes talk to someone about my problems. Sometimes it’s best to talk to someone to not keep all your feelings to yourself and you can get an opinion."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,503,"Life gets hard for everybody at some point in our lives, but we need to be able to overcome these challenges that life throws at us. I personally have been through a lot of hardships throughout my 22 years of life but I’ve never given up. When life gets challenging, I tend to motivate myself to become a better person than what I was yesterday. I remind myself that everyday that goes by, is an extra day closer to your dreams. I always aim to be a better person because being a bad person wont ever get you far in life, instead, it will take you to bad horrible places. I love motivating myself by thinking about my mother and my sisters who are the reason why I’m still going to school in order to become someone in life. I want to be an inspiration one day, where one day I can reflect back and say “I accomplished all of that”. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,511,when life gets challenging i just take a minute and assess the situation to figure out what needs to be done first do that I can get everything done on time but sometimes i forget what that is. the other thing is because i get tunnel vision often i get things done rather quickly if i know what needs to be done. Also I just like math and the sciences so it is really easy for me to get things done when they involve them. I also cope with increases in challenge well if i have time to organize and will sacrifice sleep if i need to get things done.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,525,"Being honest with myself if one of the hardest things I deal with when life presents me with some challenges. I try excelling and going above and beyond when it comes to challenges and always try to see the positive side or rewarding aspect of a challenge. This pushes me to try my hardest and not stop doing what I am doing until I feel fulfilled or that I put my best work out. It can sometimes be difficult for me due to my lack of personal acceptance. I tend to not accept failure or fear it; thus, leading me to overwork myself and make the challenge harder than it should be. However, I love challenging myself as believe life is a consistent cycle of challenges that teach and reward you in ways that you have not thought before. At the end of the day, I feel like a deal with them the best way possible by always looking out for the bright light at the end of the tunnel."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,521,"When life gets challenging my knee-jerk reaction is to slow down and sometimes stop moving forward because I subconsciously feel like that is the easiest thing to do. I feel like that may probably be the case for most people, but also that most people also know that it is not the best answer because those issues don't get resolved. When I realize that I'm stopping or giving up, I try and evaluate what I could be doing better to overcome any obstacles before me. With time, I've realized that my best plan of action is to understand what is the obstacle, what exactly is making life ""challenging"" for me, and then try to understand if there is anything that I can change. Personally I haven't encountered feelings like that for over a year, but during that time I found it difficult to move forward, and it took me admitting to myself that I was holding myself back by giving up to really get me to move forward. It took a lot of determination, but I definitely felt more confident.Going forward, I just have to remind myself that I have a lot of power over what I consider challenges in my life. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,524,"What I do when life gets hard is i got my notepad and write all the things stressing me out in order and I list the things I can do to unstress myself. I feel like I'm overloaded i self-evaluate and decide what class i need to temporarily focus on or whatever is the most urgent or difficult. I try to never get upset at myself for not finishing as much work as I wanted to, as long as i got somethings done that day  i recognize that mental breaks are just as important, and that way i wake up the next day not so dreadful of doing work. I feel more energized to get that thing done. I also like to chat and vent to friends and usually they give me excellent advice and know what to say to help me think more reasonably. It is so easy to blow things out of proportion because of fear and anxiety of not understanding, but once you tackle it instantly feels less stressful (not always lol)"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,513,"When life gets challenging I dont really have a go to thing I do. I face many of the same challenges many students face with school, the academic rigor, financial things and all the social challenges that come with being a student. With all of that its hard to find consistency so i guess i tend to just work more when things get tough because the instant reward of having money kind of lightens my load but with that it makes my school load much bigger since i dedicate less time to it so i mean i guess i dont have a great system but im still doing it and still in school. SO we'll see how far we can get doing that. ideally ill finish school and actually have something to show for all this time and effort but I guess there is no guarantee on this in the end."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,523,"Simply put, when life gets challenging one has to push through. No matter how hard and down you are you gotta push. No excuses, no exceptions. Everyone faces life challenges at some point and it is up to us how to react to them. Some people get brought down, try to find their comfort zone, and start having a ""victim"" mentality while complaining and trying to find a guilty one. And others realise that even though life is tough no one will come and save you unless you do something about your situation. One has to stay strong, have a strong mindset, and be ready to do hard work in order to overcome a challenge. This however, takes an enormous effort to look inside yourself and find power to push yourself regardless of what happens around you. Think of good moments that remind you who you are and what your goal is and keep pushing. There is no substitute for hard work. Again, STAY HARD AND STRONG!"
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,508,"Generally what I do when things in life start to become challenging, is to step back and evaluate the situation that is bothering me. Then I usually take some time to try to think about the things that I can either do or change to help make the situation that I find challenging easier for me to navigate through. Once I have formulated the plan of action I setback on to the path. If I still, however, find that my plans are not helping like I think they will then I try looking to others about how I can help my situation, and then hopefully with their help I'm able to get through my challenges. Some other ways that I may try to approach something challenging are by stepping back and taking a break from it if the situation allows for that. I find that sometimes I can get my self stuck upon trying to get through whatever is challenging me and leads me to have a foggy mind, so if I take a break and let my mind decompress it some times makes the situation easier when I reapproach it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,522,"When life gets challenging I like to go back to basics. What I mean by this is that I start remembering and going through the things I normally do to be successful, and trust that they will once again get me through. However, sometimes it is necessary to make small adjustments to adapt to the given situation. Sometimes I think about this and am thankful that I was able to rely on this method earlier in my college career. My first couple years were very rough and it took me quite a while to transfer into a four year. I am grateful for those challenges because it allows me to appreciate being at SFSU even more, and how lucky I am to be getting an education. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,528,"When life gets challenging, I try my best to continue. I like to take a step back and reassess my resources to help myself go forward. I try to learn from the people around me who have dealt with similar situations to get a better understanding of how to proceed. If I don’t know anyone with relevant experience, I make sure to assess what I know and how it can help me deal with my situation. I read relevant texts and articles, especially from experts and people with experience, for guidance. I fit the information I gleam to my situation and sift through what applies to me. I always try to remind myself that challenge and adversity can help me to strengthen my resolve and practice when I’m met with even tougher challenges that I will have to face in the future."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,520,"I am not the type of person who goes for challenges in life. So when challenges come into my life in an unexpected way, my first reaction would be run away or try anyway possible to escape. I use a different way of approaching now once I realized that was used to be my way of handling problems which did not get me anywhere. I try to confront the problem as much as I can. Instead of running away, I will calm myself first then try to solve it on my own. If the problem is challenging to the point where I could not solve it, I will ask outside help. But the most crucial point is to ask myself “What do I want in life?” Knowing my inner desire will give me strength and passion to continue pursuing the things I want when run into challenges."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,518,"When life gets challenging I get extremely stressed. In the past I have not the best at handling stress, so I would tend to freak out a little bit and go overboard with my emotions, and sometimes I would take it out on people close to me in my life. Since I am fairly independent person, I don't like to accept help from other people, and when I'm stressed this has resulted in me getting upset with my loved ones who are just trying to help me. I also tend to take on a lot at once, because I enjoy being busy, which can also increase my stress load. However, within the past 8 months or so I've been trying to work on healthy ways of handling stress, and I think it's going a bit better. I try to take my anger or stress out in physical ways (not towards other people), such as by going to the gym and lifting weights, running, or even just screaming until I'm no longer angry in my car sometimes. I think that this has helped immensely because it gives me a chance to really think about and reflect on my feelings before I take them out on someone else. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,526,"When life gets challenging, admittedly I shut down a little. It doesn't last very long, as I think I only use this as a way to reset, like when there are too many things due in the time I need to do them. I may cry or just look at my phone for a while if that happens and then get back to work with even more gumption than before. Or that is usually what happens in those cases. Sometimes I just get really stressed and continue to do things like I usually do and when I have a break I use it to the fullest extent to be able to reset that way. Most of the time, i'll talk to my boyfriend or complain at him and he'll usually say encouraging things that perk me back up a bit. If life is challenging but engaging on the other hand, usually it makes me want to work harder. For example, if I have a huge homework assignment in something I really like to do, such as Solidworks modeling, I end up working on it past my bedtime, and at some point get scolded by my boyfriend for not going to bed sooner. In general, I have a good support system for challenges in and out of school and I tend to lean on them when I need it, while trying by best by myself first. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,510,"When I was younger and life start to get difficult, I wouldn't know what to do. So I would just lash out and make poor decisions in my life. As I grow older, I learn that I can't be doing that. It would just create self harm and not help the situation.  Now I take my time to reflex on whats is the problem, why do I feel this way. I would take a step back and reevaluate my situation. First I would work, having a good sweat going helps me calm my body and mind. After I would think about all the thing that is causing my stress to rise. I would tackle them individual so it seem like a tall toll to pass. Once I find each solution for the problem. I would tackle them by setting time and day that it need to be completed. I normally start with the easier task so I mind can feel the sense of accomplishment and give myself award by saying I can do this. I would tell myself pain is temporary and this challenging time is just a small phase in life, and once I get over this hurdle, I will become stronger. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,515,"When life gets challenging, I find that exercising helps more than anything. Something about being active for 30 minutes to an hour really helps to elevate my mood, so no matter how busy I get with other parts of life, I always try to set aside at least 2 hours a week to exercise. Unfortunately this has become a little more difficult with the whole COVID-19 situation as both of the gyms that I normally visit are closed, and running outside right now isn't the best idea (because literally EVERYONE is spending more time than usual outdoors now that we're supposed to be sheltering in place - go figure)."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,514,When life gets challenging I tell myself to hunker down and deal with it. Running away from problems doesn't do anything to change them. The only way out is through. If I'm faced with a problem I have to fix it or decide that it's something I can live with because no one else can sort out my problems for me no matter how much I'd like them to. At the end of the day it's my life and ultimately my responsibility to carry on with it.
