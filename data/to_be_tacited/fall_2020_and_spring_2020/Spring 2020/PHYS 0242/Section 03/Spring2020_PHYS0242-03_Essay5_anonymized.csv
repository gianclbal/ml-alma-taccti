2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,527,"Onlines classes have impacted my learning very much. It’s hard for me to concentrate on my work when everyone is home making noise. It’s also made me lose motivation which I try to fight off but it’s hard. It’s hard to balance all of the classwork because some days I’ll do a lot of homework but then other days, I won’t do anything at all. But in the most recent weeks, I've been trying to do some homework every day so I won’t be struggling by the end of the week. I try to find a quiet space and do as much work as I can. I try to finish my school work first and then if I have free time, I’ll do whatever activities I want to do. Concerns I have about my learning is that I won’t retain the information I learned this semester. My fear is that I will struggle in my classes next semester because of online classes. Concerns for my well-being are that I will get sick. I try to avoid going outside but when I do, I get really paranoid. I’m also getting tired of being inside which I feel like may be affecting my mental health to some extent."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,513,"Online classes are not inherently bad I have taken a few classes online and it was not the worst of things. For some classes I have had it was easy to learn things because I could read up and understand things easily at least relatively since the subject matter was not the most difficult of things, but now that I am taking higher level courses such as this one (physics 242). There are some things that are hard to grasp on a virtual setting or with videos. There is something about being in a classroom that helps me focus. In terms of self-care I am trying to just exercise even just a little. In terms of my learning I am afraid I won't be able to retain the information for future classes. In terms of my well-being I will be fine not sure how to put it but I just know I'll be fine once I see my friends and family soon (once finals are done) and at an appropriate distance from each other."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,512,"online classes suck.  I work best in small groups, and with online classes i am working by myself, so i don't have others to talk to or problem solve with.  i just kind of sit here stuck on the problem, with no one around.  it makes learn a lot more difficult.  i also have less motivation to work.  the environment is not changing, at school there is a school environment and i want to get work done.  but now im only wat home, so i only have home vibes.  and home vibes are to chill out.  i am trying my best to section of times to do school work, but it is difficult when the rest of my family is also at home, working as well.  school work feels like a chore.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,503,"Well for class we were learning about thin lenses. This relates to my life because when I was about 10 years old I began to wear glasses. I tend to have astigmatism in both my eyes which is why I need glasses. Without glasses, I tend to see blurry. I began noticing a change in my vision when I was about 9 years old. Many other times we have learned about many other things like force and pressure. In society we see many car accidents happening. I am sure enough to say that there are car accidents happening in our everyday lives. As a result, sometimes we have one car who is at fault. One car may collide to another vehicle making both vehicle to get damaged due to the pressure of the force. Car accidents are dangerous because there has been many lives taken away, especially when it’s a drunk driver. This is so sad because most of the time, the drunk driver is the one to survive the car crash. People should always make the best decision and not commit a crime that will be regretful, especially when being under the influence of alcohol because the next day is when that person realizes what they have done. At that point, its too late to bring someone life back. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,520,"After I started my subject of study, I began to think about how I can give back to the community with the things I’m learning. It’s easy to think inside a small bubble. The more I learn about who I am and the people around me, the more I want to do something for them. And I began to relate the things I’m learning in class with my everyday life. When I learned about resistance and current, I began to know about how the battery works and how much power in the charges. There is more power in the charger than our phones, so it can release the power to the phones when they’re charging. Especially in the field of my major, I started to see why I should be more accountable for the work I’m doing. I began to see myself as someone who can be an engineer if I can put in enough effort. I began to see the values in my field of study as how it can help society. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,521,"I have participated in online learning classes in the past, and I felt that my general amount of learning could not compare to that in a classroom.After beginning zoom classes with SFSU, I still feel as though this is the case. Even with a great amount of effort from the students, I believe that the quality of learning just is not the same, and the amount of information being retained drops drastically. I very much appreciate the amount of effort that my professors have put into making online learning as smooth as possible. They try and engage the class to the best of their abilities, but I feel like it's still not enough to really make that great of a difference like regular semesters do. Though I have been putting effort into my online classes, I feel as though I could be doing more. Maybe I even have to do more than usual to be able to learn as much as I regularly would, that's very possible. I also plan on taking summer classes, so I think from there I will be able to better judge how well I can learn a subject during an entirely online semester. My concerns are highlighted in information retention. I worry that a lot of the material in foundational classes that I am taking at the moment won't be adequate to fully absorb information in classes during future semesters. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,516,"Online classes have seem to have become a double edged sword for me personally. One if the constant struggles si had to deal with was the less overall time to study, due to having to commute between the college campus and home. Living in the east bay, meant and a near total 3 hour bart ride front and back.  Which at first I was really glad about the online route, since I would have time to study more and commute more. However being at home all the time has led to a whole different attitude. I found my self to a whole less motivated to put in all my effort, which have shaken many of study habits and falling behind some lectures. In addition, its alot harder to get a teacher's attention to ask a question, and feel disconnected from learning via video chat. Dont get me wrong, its not the worst thing in the world, but I much prefer on campus teaching/learning. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,505,At first I didn’t think the online would work because of how classes used to be. I realized I was wrong. Online classes gave people so much time. For example my physics lab was at 3:15 to 6. My 3 hours is gone. But now our professor post the lab and we have a day to do it. This give me time to actually do the lab slowly and understand the lab and also I do much better on my lab report. I been studying more for my classes because I do my errands in the morning and at night I do my homework’s. This balances my time. When we had school we had to wake up early drive to school and be there for 8 hours. My motivation is gone already. During the online classes I more comfortable I’m home I have my coffee. It saves me at least 2 hours of driving to school also bunch of parking tickets. Now I’m in Turkey with my family spending more time with them. I was only able to see them during summer break because of school. At the moment I don’t have any concerns but i just thing they should not make attending zoom mandatory. We should get work to do and be able to watch the meeting to cover the material.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,504,"The transition I had to online classes was a little strange at first but after a week or two of getting used to it actually went by really smoothly. The hardest part I faced was trying to study with friends. Before quarantine it was a lot easier to just go to the library to meet up and study with a group of friends. Studying over Zoom is ""okay"" but there are times where internet connection makes things a little rough. In the end it's not too bad and very doable. One thing I always made sure to do was get out of bed and get to a desk for class. Getting out of bed rather than just laying in bed listening to lectures keeps me on track and prevents me from getting lazy. I don't have many or if any concerns. Hopefully summer school goes just as well. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,514,Online classes have been more challenging for me than regular classes. Being out of a classroom environment introduces more distractions to my learning and makes it harder for me to focus on the task at hand. It also takes away student interaction and collaboration which I feel is detrimental to overall learning. I stop focusing on schoolwork and do things that I enjoy such as listening to music or playing my guitar when I feel like I need a break. I am concerned that if online classes continue through next semester I may not be able to understand concepts as well as I'd need to and my grades will start to slip.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,526,"Honestly, online classes are great for me. I have a hard time being at school sometimes because I get the occasional migraine and can't commute the 1.5 hours it usually takes to get to school. Sometimes I have a hard time simply getting the motivation up to go in the first place, not that I don't want to. In a sense, online classes have helped me become a better student, which sort of sucks because it won't last. I do miss being able to get outside more and having to go to school helped me not hermit and forced me to socialize a bit. I do worry a little that I not getting enough outside time/ exercise in, but I've been going on at least weekly walks. My grades and studying did suffer for a couple weeks, but not because of online classes or not enough self care. My cat recently and suddenly passed away and that's been the main reason for any health or learning problems. My boyfriend helps when it gets to be too much though. It's just hard to focus on deadlines when you miss your furry family member. Otherwise, I could probably be a bit less lazy when it comes to eating, since Instant Ramen Noodles is so easy to make, but I don't eat it that often. It is also nice to be able to sleep in every day. My classes all start at 11 am earliest this semester, so I can still go to bed a little late and get enough sleep."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,519,"Online classes have impacted my learning in a multitude of bad ways, but I'm also finding benefits of the change. I'm fortunate enough to have a quiet space to dedicate to my classes and school-work, without any distractions or disturbances. Learning from home ultimately gives me more flexibility and down-time because I no longer have to get ready for school and make sure I've eaten and packed a lunch and all of the things my routine used to have in it that are no longer required. I'm free to take a 15 minute break to go to the kitchen and cook myself a meal or generally take care of myself with. This flexibility ultimately takes away a lot of the stress the structured life used to put on me. I function better with the freedom to do whatever, whenever. I found myself thriving this way pre-covid as well. I've always found it easier to teach myself material by reading the book and generally researching things on my own instead of under the structure of in-class lectures. My grades show higher grades from online courses than from in-person courses. However with all of this in mind, I procrastinate a lot more when things are in my own hands than when I have the structure of a schedule. I'm struggling to find the balance of maintaining a free-flowing schedule and establishing a routine for my learning. It's definitely a change that requires a ton of mental and obviously physical shifts, but it's not the worst thing in the world."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,524,"At first I felt that online-classes were somewhat easier on me mentally than in-person classes, but as we got into the rhythm of online learning it is has become a lot more difficult to juggle so many different classes and emails. I guess this is how professors must feel but I did not expect it to be so hard to keep track of all assignments. I do miss the interaction of in-class lecture and labs, I feel like it is a lot easier to absorb information in a setting that's strictly for education, it is very easy to get distracted by my cute dog trying to play or casually on my phone. I would mostly workout 5x a week to destress and just to stay in shape, but I had an eye accident making me unable to workout for a month. So for self care I've mostly just worked on my skincare and going on walks with my dad. I thought about buying a bike and just bike around to unload my thoughts.I am afraid that my online labs next semester will not be as beneficial as working with actual equipment. I do not want to miss out on experiences that will help me get a better understanding of how I can actually apply the ideas discussed in lecture to real life. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,518,"Online classes have definitely impacted my learning negatively. I don't pay attention well in my house where there's many distractions, and I just get too lazy sometimes to even go to class or pay attention during lectures. I just really don't have the mindset I need to be in in order to absorb information properly when I'm not in a classroom setting. Online classes have also negatively impacted my well-being. I can't go to the gym daily to relieve stress, and I also don't get to see friends and classmates that really keep me centered. It's also incredibly stressful for me to not be able to interact with people on a daily basis because I am an extremely sociable person. I've found myself getting stir-crazy, sad, irritable, stressed..a lot of negative emotions. I am very concerned about my education for this and next semester (as the SFSU President has declared that we will continue with online learning next semester), because I don't believe I'm retaining the information I desperately need for my career. I feel as though I'm breezing by in classes and not absorbing any actual information, just doing the assignments and getting grades for them. I'm also concerned that my mental health will continue to deteriorate the longer quarantine continues, since it has only been two months and I am already in a very negative head space."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,528,"Online classes have been a mixed bag in several departments. They’ve helped me in some ways since I don’t have to commute to school daily early in the morning and late in the evening. I have a lot more time to study and relax, even between classes. I also like being able to attend classes from the comfort of my own home. They’ve also introduced some difficulties. It’s difficult to discuss some things with my teachers, such as topics I’m struggling with, as cameras don’t make good substitutes for reality when I want to discuss a topic visually. It also makes some of my classes impossible, such as labs, as the physical element is necessary for some of them. All my classes also lost a lot of time to try to adapt to the current situation. As a result, they’ve had to cut some topics that may affect my learning later on. As far as what I’m doing for my well-being, I’m trying to take advantage of the extra time I now have. I’m also making sure to stay in touch with my friends since I can’t meet with them in person. I’m concerned that it’ll be difficult to go back to normal after this situation as it’ll be a drastic change to go back to commuting to school every day and staying at school for so long."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,522,"Online classes have been interesting for me, personally. I am thankful that it has not hit me as hard as it has some of my peers, however it is still a less than ideal situation. First and foremost, I feel like my classes just got a lot tougher, since the online learning environment is not something I am used to. I have taken an easy GE course here and there online in the past, but a whole semesters worth (18 units total, ENGR,PHYS,MATH,SCI subjects) was a whole different ball game. Starting with the negative so that I may end on a good note: exams and quizzes are a nightmare because you hope and pray that no technical difficulties happen, and that you are able to submit it on time. Not only that, but you also have to think that if you do ""too well"" on an exam, you could be flagged for cheating or instructors could start thinking that you might be up to something. On the flip side, instructors are usually a lot more lenient when grading, so if I do well on an exam, I wonder if it was really my own effort or if the professor gave pity points. I am all and well for passing with a good grade, but I also have something to prove to myself so I would obviously value the score a lot more if it would have been in a classroom setting. That being said, it has allowed me to also spend more time with family and pets, as well as take better care of my rest and eating schedule. I no longer have a daily 4 hour commute (2hrs each way including bart and bus/waiting) and thus am able to stay healthier and have more time to do things.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,510,"Online class has dramatically impacted my learning and grades. In all of my classes I am not doing so good. I put myself to a higher standard and know I can get A in all my classes but now during quarentine and online classes, my grades are in the B range. Maybe this is my last semester and I just want to school to be done with. I know humans are great at adapting to things so maybe I just need a little more time to get settle in with have no library, quiet place and time to study. I had a good routine and know my location to study before quarantine. Now it has been hard for me to find that same routine. I still get a workout in almost everyday at home just to relax. It is a good way for my brain to mentally suck down and just do physically labor. The only thing I have a hard time with is having lecture online and a place to study. It is easy to have a classroom where everyone is focus on the teacher then having a online lecture where some people don't have a quiet place to focus. Thanks you for this semester and  take care. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,511,the only class that I have had trouble with is physics lecture because with physics i am more of a visual learner and our professor prefers to use power point over actually using the white board with this translating to entire lectures with only power point and minimal notes. the other classes are alright the only problem is the significant increases in homework and shortened deadlines because of online classes. The things I do to take care of myself are just to give myself downtime to relax and then back to work because without it I am kind of aimless without knowing what to do. Also just doing tings that I like to do in between doing work so I don't burn myself out while doing it. the only concerns is that because there is no in class meeting anymore the urgency of homework and work in general becomes less so and I forget what needs to be done because I have no structured schedule to put it against. I am fine indoors most of my time is spent indoors because of the amount of homework i get and me wanting to get it done before it is due so i don't forget it later.      
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,508,"I would say that switching over from traditional classes and moving over to all online classes has been a pretty rough transition for me personally. In particular, I just find it really difficult to stay focused and on task when listening to lectures at my home desk rather than in person at school. I find myself always checking to see how much longer until the lecture is over during online classes, which isn't something I was doing when in class in person. Another issue I have had is just finding the motivation to stay on task and get my assignments done, I have unfortunately missed more than a few assignments just because I put them off for too long and end up accidentally forgetting about them. Still I somehow manage to keep things going for the most part. I'm fortunate that I don't have to worry about having a personal computer to be able to get my assignments done and the other necessities required for online school environment unlike many others out there that are struggling. Overall I'm just trying to keep a positive attitude through it all and take it day by day."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,525,"Online classes at the very beginning were challenging due to some professor not being able to efficiently perform as they wanted and some not really liking the platform due their type of teaching. However, me personally was greatly benefitted from this change as I didn’t need to commute no longer and have been used to online learning already. I personally like the freedom online classes give but it is very hard to keep-up with yourself sometimes specially during a time of crisis. I personally practice self-care during this quarantine by embracing the freedom online classes and staying at home orders with creating a well-structured sleeping habit to go down by midnight and wake up early 9-10AM, exercising twice a week, walking around the neighborhood three times a week, and doing homework/virtual classes on a different setting in the house everyday. Those little activities slowly starting becoming a habit, and after 56 days of staying at home, I’ve been able to continue those habits and feel less mentally stressed in regards to classes and life. However, I have also been in need to take over extra shifts and days at work due to some family member being laid off. I have been able to manage school and work so far efficiently but I know I definitely will need a break from it soon.  My main concern at this time is more about the future of college classes and my degree, as I am halfway through my bachelor’s degree and I feel like it is going to be very challenging if this pandemic continues. In regards of my well-being, I definitely fear the virus and fear the lack of people’s respect for others will lead to greater issues than what we are facing today."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,515,"Quarantine was going fine until I ran out of medication. I get my medication through the school and now that campus is closed, and I don't have insurance, I've been running dry. It's been about a month since I've last taken my medication and I'm really starting to feel the negative side-effects.Also, for some reason online classes have made my classes much more difficult. They are objectively easier, but now I find it much more difficult to study or stay motivated to do the work. I thought that not having to commute to and from the city everyday (I live in Oakland) but be beneficial, but I've just been working more so I actually have less time now. Ever since I've heard that next semester will be online only as well, I've been considering taking the semester off. I don't want to take any more time to graduate than I already have, but if next semester goes the same way this one does, there wouldn't be much point to me taking classes anyways. The last thing I want to do is sign up for classes, spread myself to thin, and end up failing classes and wasting my time / money. I've signed up for a class during summer and I'll be using that to gauge whether or not I should bother taking classes over Fall or not. As it stands right now, I feel like I would just be wasting everyone's time, but who knows? Maybe I'll be used to this whole situation by then."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,509,"Doing classes online has really changed a lot of parts of my life. There are definitely a lot of benefits. I get to sleep in later since I don't have to commute. However, as crazy as it sounds, I used to love going to the school library before it opened at 8. It was always so quiet and peaceful. It was a perfect time to get work done. I feel so lazy now. It seems like I'm just as busy though. I can't wait for summer break. I'm taking classes over the summer so I'm only going to have a week off in between. It's going to be online as well. Hopefully it goes okay. It's a lot harder to learn online than in person. The one benefit is being able to view the recorded lectures over and over again for studying. Honestly, I don't know how I feel about online classes. I wish they had notified us a day or two before hand before we started doing online classes just so I could say goodbye to friends. One friend I have is graduating and now I'm not sure when the next time I'll see her will be. I think the hardest part about being at home is not being able to see people face to face. Seeing friends always made my day a bit brighter. Now I might now see them until the end of next January. I guess my self care would be texting/chatting with people online and trying to get outside as much as I can. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,506,"At first, I was on-board with the online classes because I felt that this gave me more time to study and focus on things that were not school related. After a few weeks, I really started feeling less motivated to study. One of the reasons was that I was so accustomed to going out and doing things to get my mind off school. Not being able to go to the gym, the movies, and having less contact with others left me with very few options to decompress from school related work. I have been alone for most of this quarantine period. I was alone in my apartment in Oakland, and then I decided to move back to the house I own in Riverside where I am still living alone. I talk to friends and family from time to time over the phone, but I am really missing seeing people in person. I am trying my best to keep myself motivated. On a positive note, being back at my house has helped. I am able to sit outside in my yard, make upgrades to my house, and I am thinking of starting a garden this week. Also, the semester is drawing to a close soon and that gives me the extra push I need to move forward. I am also looking forward to returning to my job as a carpenter foreman immediately after finals are over. I am concerned that online classes are going to carry over to the fall semester and I will not be able to get the most out of my last year at SFSU. I really miss walking around campus and spending time with all of my friends and classmates. Many of my classes require a lab, and I feel that its in those labs where I end up learning so much. I know that moving forward, things will not return to normal, but I do hope to go back to school at least in the spring to complete my final semester and experience my senior year at SFSU."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,523,"Online classes impacted my learning in different ways. For some classes, transition to online was not a big deal because professor's lectures were still interesting and engaging but for others, it was a huge change. Some professors are great lecturers even online but for other classes, I had to put much more effort into understanding a lecture than I would do in-person. Regardless, I am trying to do my best in terms of school, which includes studying, reviewing the material, and keeping track of deadlines. One thing I have noticed while being at home is that it is much harder for me to focus because there are so many other distractions. Every time time I sit to do a homework, I think I should get some water, so I go into the kitchen, but there are dirty dishes so I start washing them, and them something else comes up... But I try to do my best to get all the assignments and studying done on time. While being inside, I also think taking some time off is very important because otherwise, I will get burnt out very quickly. Taking short breaks every hour, being fed, hydrated, and well-rested helps me power through my school. I actually was not able to maintain all these things during a regular semester, so I guess there are a couple of benefits of online learning too. First, classes seem to be easier, which makes me take more of them in order to graduate faster. Second, I do not have to spend time commuting back and forth to campus even though I live pretty close by. The only concern I have about the upcoming fall semester is having only one or two labs that require me to stay in SF. I am currently living in Southern California, and I do not have to pay rent, but if I have only one lab in-person, that will require me staying in the city without having a job because of the quarantine closure and so I will not be able to pay rent."
