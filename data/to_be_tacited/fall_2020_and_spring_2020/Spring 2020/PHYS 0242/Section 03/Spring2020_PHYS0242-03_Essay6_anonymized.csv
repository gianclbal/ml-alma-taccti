2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,527,"The reason I want to go into my major is because ever since I was little, I’ve always been interested in astrophysics. I’ve mainly been interested in astronomy. I’ve always wanted to know what’s outside of our own planet and learn how our universe works. Obviously, I don’t think I’ll ever know how our universe works but if I could help society by discovering new facts, I would feel accomplished. At first, I felt intimidated by the subject and wanted to switch majors but no other major has ever caught my attention. I would rather try my major than to give up and study something easier. I think I would really regret it later on in life and think about what could’ve been if I had just stuck to it."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,512,"my major is civil engineering.  i like it because it fits me.  my older sister went into computer science, my older brother went into mechanical engineering, my parents both have computer science degrees.  when i was younger, i looked around and found civil to interest me the most.  i like math and physics.  the idea of building a bridge/building/road and have other people use it everyday, i dont know i have so satisfaction from it.  like all that hard work is being put to the test and others are enjoying/using it just makes me happy.  "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,505,The reason I want to go in to Stem field is because since I was a little kid  i always have been interested in cars. I love repairing cars taking them apart and modifying them. As a mechanical engineer I can do a lot with cars. Maybe I can build my engine one day and built my own car. Currently I have opened up my own shop on vinyl wrapping. Everyday I get different types of car and It surprises me all the time because of how the car are built. My favorite of all is the BMW. I believe German engineering is the best one of all. All the cars they built are the best one. They always motivate me and makes me wanna work more. Another reason i want to be a engineer is because of my family. My dad always told me he wanted me to be a engineer since I was a kid because he didn’t have the opportunities when he was a kid and h knew my interest in cars and now I want to keep my promise the pursue my carrier as a engineer. Hopefully one day I can graduate from San Francisco State University.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,515,"I chose my major (mechanical engineering) because I wanted to avoid majoring in a field that would be difficult to find a job in with only a Bachelors degree. After spending almost 10 years pursuing a career in a very luck-based field where your individual success rode on who you knew, I wanted a very clear path to a career. This made engineering an easy choice, and I was drawn to the mechanical side in particular because for me it felt more intuitive and less ""magical"" than electrical. zThis isn't to say that I picked this major out of a hat however. I've always felt drawn to this sort of work, but in the past I assumed a defeatist attitude based on the notion that I would never be good at math and therefore any discipline which required math was out of reach. Well, I'm still not good at math, but I do well enough to make it work. I've heard that depending on which industry you go into, math isn't all that necessary anyway, and so I feel like I've made the right decision (at least for now)."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,524,When I decided to be an electrical engineer major it wasn't because I've always dreamed of being an electrical engineer. I chose this route because I knew that engineering as a general field was something I thought I could do (and the salary seemed perfect to me). From a young age I was always drawn to science and math more than any other subject so it would make sense why I am in a STEM field. I chose electrical specifically because I thought it could have many applications that even I could use on a day to day basis. Now that I am in my major I have found a new appreciation and interest in how math and science can work harmoniously together. I honestly did not imagine myself this far even though it is only my 4th semester. I am excited to learn more and see where my degree can take me.
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,525,"I decided to pursue civil engineering due to my learning capacity in sciences. I always felt like science courses, specially the ones related to math, were a great stimulus for my brain and I was always able to excel on them. During my junior year of high school in Spain, I was able to meet one professor of civil engineering who pretty much instilled the idea of becoming an engineer one day and inspired me to pursue that career. Civil engineering is a major that will open doors for me specially living in San Francisco, where structural developments are at their peak and I hope one day to be in part of them. I also decided to pursue this career in hope to help my family in Peru, where civil engineering development is not as strong as in United States. I always had the dream of being able to create something out there and help developing structures that will support Peruvian’s transportation systems and living areas."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,518,"I originally wanted to go into my major because my mom advised me against pursuing architecture, saying it wasn't a job that paid well. She and I both wanted something for me where I wouldn't struggle financially, where I could learn and challenge myself, and where I would be happy. Influenced by both of my parents (who are both engineers), I decided to major in mechanical engineering, which seemed like a very diverse field that involved designing (that was the appeal of architecture to me). Over the past three years as a mechanical engineering major, I have learned and discovered so many cool things that have made me fall in love with it even more. I especially love CAD and 3D design, and I think artificial intelligence is incredibly dope. I also really love the concept of electric and clean energy, and I would absolutely love to work from Tesla after graduation."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,528,"I want to go into my major because I’m passionate about astronomy and physics. I find physics interesting because it describes how the world works at varying levels of difficulty and accuracy as you learn more. I find astronomy interesting because it describes how celestial bodies incomprehensibly larger than us operate in an even greater vacuum. I find it fun to learn more about different topics in astrophysics as they all imply amazing things about how the universe works. For instance, I find it incredible how there are massive spheres of burning hydrogen that burn bright enough that we can see them even though they’re unimaginably far away. I also find it amazing that there are objects so densely packed that electrons and protons have fused into neutrons, forming a mass several times the mass of our Sun in an area comparable to a large city. I want to continue to learn about these incredible phenomena so that I can one day add to the pool of knowledge."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,522,"The reason I want to get into Mechanical engineering is because I would like to help people. I would like to do this by trying to improve public transportation in one way or another. One of the things that concerns me is infrastructure overload in the Bay Area. One day when I was commuting to SF from the east bay, I was stuck in traffic that was so terrible, I actually had time to safely look around me for a quick second and take in the massive number of cars that were covering up every square inch of road.   If BART, as an example, could save money by either making more energy efficient light rail trains, or in other ways like more efficient, garbage proof escalators (they spent like 30M dollars in escalators a few years back). Then maybe they could put more trains on the track at shorter intervals, and expand into more neighborhoods which could be chosen analytically based on need, we could help take cars of the road and at the same time move people faster.   Obviously, this does not consider security, cleanliness, and other challenges that currently plague our local public transport systems. This side of things also need to be thought about, which goes to show the massive amount of people of different majors and backgrounds necessary to whip up something truly spicy."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,516,"I wanted to get into my current major, mechanical Engineering, mostly because I’m really interested in physics and math, and would like to find a profession that allows me to continue learning about science and math. On a personal note, I actually hope to one day  help design or create something that would make a better place. Whether be part of a team that would lead an innovative way to produce energy, invent a system that allows for more efficient travel. Or even help evolve something that I love, like trains, airplanes, or  even spaceships. In a way it’s always been a dream of mine to be part of something bigger."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,520,"The reason why I want to go into my major is that it gives a sense of satisfaction knowing that being a civil engineer can give back to society. It also will give me a sense of accomplishment. It is hard to find something you like and good at doing. It is a lifelong journey exploring our wants and needs. Especially being a human, we have to do something extraordinary to fulfill the needs of our inner self which is to help people who are in need of something that we can contribute. Living is not about being materialistic, but ultimately we need that for surviving. I enjoy doing things with my hands. Knowing that I am good at math and interested with structural things, my first instinct was to be an interior designer. However, since I am not good at drawing, I decided to choose civil engineering as my major."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,526,"At first I wanted to go into mechanical engineering because I thought it was cool and I always loved designing things and working with my hands. Then I learned about LFTRs (Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors) and MSRs (Molten Salt Reactors) in general and thought that was the best thing ever, so now my reasoning is that I want to be a part of making LFTRs or MSRs a normal thing in the nuclear power industry. I have some ideas that I think will be great for the future, and if they don't work out, i'll still be working on awesome machinery. As a plus, a mechanical engineers licence is a recipe for a good salary, so that's cool too. Kirk Sorensen said in a documentary (I think it's Thorium Remix 2011, available online for free if you want to check it out) about his discovery of MSRs that mechanical engineers would be a big help for the future and I took his words to heart. At this point, i'm probably a fan of Kirk Sorensen, but in the end, I chose mechanical engineering because it fits with me so well. This is not mentioning that it takes me more than 5 times longer than the average person to write an essay because my ADHD, distraction prone self, has a hard time putting sentences together outside my head. I'm great at picturing complex shapes in my head almost perfectly though, so that's another reason to be in this major."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,510,"Ever since I was young, I like to solve puzzle, and work with my hands. English was not my strong subject but math was. Math felt easy to me and made sense. I did have a lot of practice with math because I went to Kumon, a tutoring center, but I felt like it was easy for me to understand math than words. As I grow older, I work my hand and became a mechanic. Over the years working in that field, I learn a lot about how auto industry work by repairing all of their vehicle, Some manufacture I can tell by working on their vehicle have poor designs. Instead of fixing their problems are they have been made, why not be the person who make the product and try to limit the flaws. That was when I decided to go back to school and become a mechanic engineer. Also, the mechanic field felt like a dead end job with minimal growth, yet extreme health risk and damages. Engineering have higher career growth and less physical demand on the body. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,517,"The reason why I want to go into my major is not just because I know that Mechanical Engineering makes a good amount of money, but also because my passion (cars) is relatable to Mechanical Engineering. So in some ways, it's helping/motivating me to try my best to advance in this major and to get my bachelor's degree. To be honest, I had a lot of fall backs in my mind as to whether I should continue with this major or not. The reason is because of grades, subjects that I sometimes would not understand, bad professors that don't help you motivate to do good in class, etc. But luckily, having my dad who is an electrical engineer, helped motivate me into continuing with my major and enduring all the troubles that would come with it, but to help me understand that it is all worth it in the long run. So that is why I got into Mechanical Engineering. I am hoping to finish this major within a couple years at max. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,519,"I want to go into engineering because of the stability of the career. I like the challenges it presents and I like the concept of my career being essentially a series of puzzles for me to work on and solve masked as different ""projects"" to better ""society"". I'd like to work in something that pushes me intellectually and I think I'll find that with being an engineer. My mom is an engineer, and she inspired my choice to become one as well. She is well into her career as one, and she is still growing and advancing and learning in her career. I also like the idea of working towards improving the society we live in, whether it be building new structures, bridges, machines, sustainable materials, or literally anything that advances our modern world even further into the future. It took me a long time to arrive to the conclusion that I should become an engineer (I'm 23 years old and I've been in college for 6 years and I have 2 more to go) but it's one I'm sure of."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,513,"I want to go into my major because it really is the only major that interested me enough to actually make me want to study it. There are many great majors offered, but I just didn't feel called to it. I have been working labor for a long time and well it seems like a good field to go into. Oh wait I haven't said what my major is. The major that I decided to go into is civil engineering. Oh also it's asking why I wanted to go into it. Lets see yeah thats why it is just interesting and I think too because I could be making more money than my dad who for 25 year was an illegal alien so he told me if he could be as successful as he has been having no resources and having everything stacked against him I can do better because I really am so privileged even just being born in the United States."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,508,"Originally I want to get my degree in Computer Science, but I eventually found out that it wasn't for me, so I made the switch to Civil Engineering. I guess the reason that I chose to go into to Civil Engineering is that I liked the idea of planning out, designing, and building different structures and building to help people out. Some other things that got me interested in Civil Engineering is the Environmental Engineering side of it. I think its absolutely essential that we all do what we can to protect the natural beauty of our planet and environmental engineering would allow me to be able to allow me to have a greater contribution in that. Another thing about is Construction Engineering, I just love the idea of being able to design and plan out and project, and then being able to bring it all to life and see it grow is something the seems very satisfying to me."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,511,"I wanted to go into my major because I enjoy building and understanding how things work. then i wish to go into more advanced subject once I get more knowledge and build even more complex structure. the other reason is that engineering is a prestigious job, later on i may want to teach other people about it so they can enjoy it as well. These are my main reasons but the third is that it is also a a job that pays well and can go anywhere because everywhere needs a engineer especially a electrical engineer. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,509,"I think I've always wanted to go into computer science, even before I knew what it was. When i was six or seven I used to have a small Hello Kitty white board that I used to draw on all the time. I remember drawing up websites/games that were probably similar to Club Penguin (which I had just begun to play). When I got a little older I played these Carmen Sandiego educational CD games that use to be my brother's. I've always loved the idea of learning/teaching through a game or story. I'd love to be a part of something that involves education and technology. I Spreading information is one of the most important parts of the internet in general. There is so much that's possible with computer science. You can create anything you want. It's such a powerful tool and I'd love to be able to do something good with it.   "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,521,"My major is mechanical engineering. I want to go into my major because I like making things, solving problems, making things more efficient, and most importantly, I like cars.Cars and technology are my true passions, and I feel that with a mechanical engineering background, I will be able to work in jobs that revolve around those interests of mine. I also highly value job stability, so a job in engineering seems like a great path for a successful future, in my eyes. I enjoy learning about physics and learning how important man-made inventions were created. I also really value what engineering work has done to advance and improve our lives in general. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,506,"My major is civil engineering. I got into this major because I have worked construction for most of my life. I have helped in the construction of many different types of projects and have contributed in different ways. From framing steel exterior walls, lathing, and hanging gypsum board to managing a crew of over 20 people and coordinating with project managers to ensure that a project was completed within budget and on-time. Construction has been a part of my life and I wanted to know all aspects of it. I got to a point in my career that I felt like I needed to learn more about it, so I decided to enroll in school and pursue a degree in civil engineering. The knowledge I have gained while I have been school has helped me view construction in a new way. I am really happy that I made this decision and look forward to learning so much more."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,523,"I have always been passionate about technology and making things work. When I was little I used to spend hours every single day playing LEGOs and learning new things. I believe my curiosity was one of the reasons why I chose engineering as my major. Yes, engineering is hard, yes, things do not always work, and yes, it is time consuming. But guess what... That very moment when I solve a puzzle, make my code or Arduino do what I want it to do a sense of joy comes to me. There is no feeling, which makes me happier than knowing my hard work brought me good results. I believe that Electrical Engineering has a lot of potential due to its wide variety of specialisations. Combine it with a Computer Science program and your variety quadruples. I have not yet figured out what specific field of EE I wish to go but there are several ones that I keep an eye on. Communication systems and Wireless communications are just a couple of examples that can greatly benefit the world we live in. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,503,"I want to go into my major of electrical engineering because my entire life I’ve had nothing. My supportive system comes from a single mother, I want to do this for my mom and my sisters so that one day we can have a big house. I joined electrical engineering because I’ve always been good at math, I am more of a problem solver type of guy. Rather than a person who tends to memorize a lot of things. For example, I remember I wanted to be a nurse but I know that I was going to have trouble remembering all the medical words and knowing parts of the human body. I also joined electrical engineering because the pay is really good. I want to be able to help my mom out with her bills and buy her a house one day because I am the person that I am today, all thanks to her. Also after I get my bachelors in electrical engineering, I will want to receive my masters in biomedical engineer. I want to help people in need who don’t have the money to buy artificial body parts. I want to be able to create these artificial belongings and donate it to the people in need. "
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,514,"I originally picked my major (electrical engineering) because my options were either STEM major or get disowned. I decided on electrical engineering because I figured I'd be able to use the knowledge I acquire modify and build things relating to guitar amplifiers, effects pedals, and such. Often times I still do feel like I don't want to go into this major. I have no real passion for what I study which is all the more apparent to me when I work with my peers who seem genuinely delighted by the subject. However, I must say the more time I spend working through these courses and spending time around other students in my major, the more I find this course of study to be tolerable. Not to say I find myself enjoying it, but gradually electrical engineering seems to become less repulsive."
2020,Spring,PHYS 0242,--,3,504,"The major I am currently in is Civil Engineering; however, I was actually majoring in Architecture just before. One thing that really convinced me to switch over to civil engineering was an internship with the City of San Francisco. Even though it was a short two months, I had really enjoyed working in construction management and knew this is what I wanted to do in the future for a career. After working for the City I was also able to learn about how I would not have the freedom to fully design something. There are many restrictions and rules that must be followed when designing a building for the City and I knew that is something I would not like. "
