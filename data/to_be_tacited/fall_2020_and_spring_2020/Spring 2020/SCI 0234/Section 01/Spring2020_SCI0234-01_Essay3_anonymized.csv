2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,487,"The values of my family helped me a lot. Basically everytime I encounter a problem or challenges, I will think of my family and that they trust me that I'm able overcome these obstacles and graduate from college."
2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,219,"One of my communities continually enforced the idea that making mistakes is part of the learning process. That is why throughout college when I have inevitably made mistakes here and there, I never let them keep me down for long before I know to move on and to learn from my mistakes.This same community also taught me to stay strong and persevere through hard times, for not only do they not last forever, but how you overcome them helps shape who you are and builds your character. In college, I have had rough patches here and there that I wish I had never gone through. Looking back on those times recently, I realized that how I got through those times to get to where I am at today is part of my story. I recount those memories as some that I went through but I can help others avoid by making sure they are aware of pre-existing factors that can eventually lead to those harder times that many go through during college.One last concept that was drilled into me is that when you want something, you have to be willing to work hard for it. Especially when you want to elevate your current conditions, you have to put in the effort first before you can see any changes. I was a poor student at many points in college where I thought I could just get by in my classes and for some subjects do the minimal work, but going through college like that is nowhere nearly as satisfying as putting in the work and effort and knowing all that dedication resulted in a satisfactory grasp of the material."
2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,695,"I think my family and my community played a big role in helping me navigate through college. Unlike most Asian parents, my parents did not really care about what I was studying in college. They did not really force me to study a certain major such as something in the health field or lawyer field. They told me to choose what I had an interest in studying which gave me a lot of motivation to go to college. They did not care what I was studying as long as I was attending college itself. They care more for the fact that I am trying to pursue a degree in higher education more than what I'm studying. As for my community, I joined a program called College track all throughout high school that helped me get to college and where I am now. They hooked me up with mentors and tutors that helped support my way to college and until I graduate so that program is another thing that is helping me navigate through college right now.Â "
