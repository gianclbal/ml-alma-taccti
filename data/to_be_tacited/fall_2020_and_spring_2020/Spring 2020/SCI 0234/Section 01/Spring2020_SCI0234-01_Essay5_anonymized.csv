2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,219,"I want to go into the STEM field because I was always fascinated by science, technology, and engineering growing up as a kid. More specifically, I am interested in their applications in real-world situations. Projects that range from improving and innovating a specific product on the market like creating flying cars, to positively impacting the longevity of this world itself through solar technology, the work needed to continually strive to accomplish these feats lies in the STEM field. To me, as daunting as it is to equip myself with the necessary knowledge through a STEM degree, I believe that once I am that moment where I am working on a diverse range of projects in innovation, I will find a type of fulfillment in my life from accomplishing one of my goals and not giving up or caving into other career fields. While I am actually interested in various fields of study such as some aspects of business or even in teaching, having an expertise in engineering and technology is where I want my focus to be in terms of professional development. There is just something about the STEM field that really catches my interest, perhaps the limitless possibilities in innovation and discoveries that are out there just waiting to be uncovered; and no, I am not planning on uncovering them myself, but I do want to be part of the development of concepts and ideas and how things came to be. I personally have met a good amount of people who work in the STEM field and the way that they convey what they work on makes me want to also be able to communicate like them in the future. Overall, while I have a deep respect for people with expertise and dedication to their chosen field(s), I highly admire those in the STEM field and know that one day I would like to build myself up to the point where I can work on different types of STEM projects and potentially work under the influence of tech giants who have a very real positive impact on the lives of everyday people."
2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,487,"I wanted to go into this major is because I want to work in this field. I am always interested in building stuff and working on mechanical stuff since I'm a child. After I graduate from high school, I joined the military as a helicopter mechanic, and by the time I got out of the military, I decided that I want a degree in mechanical engineering and possibly get some similar job upon graduation."
