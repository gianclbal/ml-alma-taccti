2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,487,"One of the topics that we covered in class is current. By knowing how the current work and the conceptual of current, I kind of understand how some of the wiring and electrical stuff works in our daily life. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,219,"The concepts that I am choosing to talk about are Ohm’s Law and power. My question is: what is the relationship between light bulbs and their power consumption? First, it is helpful to know and understand the variables in Ohm’s Law and how they relate to everyday applications. Ohm’s Law uses the equation V = IR, where V = voltage (measured in volts), I = current (measured in amperes, or amps), and R = Resistance (measured in ohms). You can manipulate the variables in Ohm’s law to calculate the value of power given the variables you are given: P = IV = I2R = V2/R. A national standard for the voltage delivered through an average power outlet is 120 volts. With that in mind, if we know the voltage V and use an ammeter to measure the current from the outlet to the electrical appliance, we can multiply both values and find the wattage of the appliance. For example, the most common maximum wattage of a light bulb is 60 watts. We can then move around the variables in the equation P = IV to solve for I: I = P/V. Knowing P = 60 W and V = 120 V, we can conclude that I = 0.5 A. We can see that the current usage is relatively low, and you can see that as power increases, the current required will also increase. I believe this is why a maximum wattage is generally found for light bulbs so that light bulbs do not draw out too much current. This is especially important because most of the population uses electricity every day and since we all pay our electricity bills, how much we end up paying per month can very well depend on our understanding of electricity and how we take advantage of our use of it."
