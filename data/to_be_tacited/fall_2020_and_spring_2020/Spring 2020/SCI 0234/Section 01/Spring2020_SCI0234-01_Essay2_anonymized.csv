2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,695,"When life gets challenging I am not the type of person to give up easily just because it is hard. I like to see a challenge as a way to grow and improve on what I do not know. Challenging events in my life are not something that I think will help me slow down on what I am doing. I find a challenge as a way to work harder and use a challenging experience as a way to expand my knowledge. Although it will be very easy to just give up and not continue when things get hard, I think in the long term it will be beneficial to myself. When things get challenging for me, I like to have a growth mindset and think of it as something that will be a positive thing for me instead of something that is setting me up to fail. When life gets challenging I like to ask for help from others, I realized for myself that when I try to do things by myself I have a stronger urge to try and give up. Challenges are helpful in helping me reach my goals, the challenges I face in my life is a way to help me build character. I believe that all good work comes from struggle and challenge. So I don't see challenges as a bad thing but more as a good thing.Â "
2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,219,"When life gets challenging, I always need time to recharge and take a step back to look at things from a bigger-picture standpoint. Sometimes when you are in the middle of everything, you get tunnel vision and become blindsighted. Since I am my most efficient self when I am calculated and organized, I take the time to re-evaluate things.I acknowledge that going through challenges are necessary in growing as an individual and I use that to motivate me to move forward from any potential setbacks. I also go to my friends who I feel comfortable opening up to and express my feelings so that I do not just keep them weighted in my head.Other times, depending on the challenge(s), I resort to activities such as meditation and working out to help clear my mind. Clearing my mind often helps me reconsider certain challenges under a clearer mind."
