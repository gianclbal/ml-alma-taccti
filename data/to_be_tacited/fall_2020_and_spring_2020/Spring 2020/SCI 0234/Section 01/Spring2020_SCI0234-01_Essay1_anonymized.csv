2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,695,"Today I will be talking about why I chose to attend San Francisco State University, and why I am here today. I was born and raised in the city of San Francisco and I love the city that I live in. I could not imagine myself living in any other city, so I chose to stay here and attend university here. Although it would be nice to move out of my parent's house and experience living on my own, no city besides San Francisco really spoke out to me. Not only did I choose San Francisco State University because it was located at home, but I also chose it because I really liked the campus and there focus on ethnic studies. At the university, I have taken many Asian American studies courses and I really enjoyed these classes they offer because it gives me the chance to learn about my culture while also knocking out some general education requirements. Also a lot of my close friends while growing up in the city where continuing their higher education at San Francisco State University so I thought it would be enjoyable to attend college with them too. I feel as if every university can give you the same quality of education depending on how much effort you decide to put in, which is why I chose to attend this university."
2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,219,"I am here because despite all the order that needs to be in place for our universe and the things in it to be in relative equilibrium, I am a product of the spontaneity of our universe. I am here because as humans, we learned to be more present and to have direction in our lives. I believe the human experience is to build and develop a purpose in our lives beyond our primal instincts using the complex minds that we were gifted with. For me personally, I have chosen to try to be a positive effect on those who I am connected with. In this present moment, I am building myself up through education and experiences so that later in my life, I will be able to contribute to the personal growth of others and help them through their endeavours."
2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,696,"I am taking SCI 234 to improve my skills in Physics 230. I know Physics with Calculus 2 will be more rigorous than Physics with Calculus 1 so I want to be well -prepared for that course. Physics with Calculus 2 is an important part of my overall major so I want to make sure I understand every concept we study in class. This course also serves as a study session for me which forces me, in a way, to actually learn in a structured environment rather than on my own. The former has many draw backs as I am easily distracted and my time management skills are not fully developed. Furthermore, I get to learn and work with like-minded individuals who have similar goals.  I took and passed Physic with Calculus 1 a year ago and I struggled at the beginning and towards the end of the course. Also, because I took so long to take the next course, I forgot a lot of what I had learned. Tutoring at San Francisco Sate University is limited by the hours and number of tutors available. This class serves me in multiple ways which helps me learn without having to go to tutors all the time."
2020,Spring,SCI 0234,SI,1,482,"I am here in this course because it is going to make me a more successful student and aid my learning.  But the bigger picture of ""why I'm here"" is that every decision I've made and everything that has happened to me and the people around me in my life has led me to where I am.  I am here because I am supposed to be here.  Sometimes I know why I am where I am in an exact moment and sometimes I figure that out later down the road.  I am here because I am pursuing a higher education because I want to earn a degree and have a career.  I am here because I chose to be here and I was given the opportunity to be here."
