Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,562,"Why am I here?I am here because I struggle in chemistry. I have taken 3 chemistry courses in community college, and have not been successful all three times. I chose this course right before the add date deadline because I knew it would be hard for me to pass chem 115 on my own, and I want to utilize all the extra resources I have. I am also taking organic and biochemistry so passing this 5 unit course is very important to me in order for me to graduate on time. I am glad my professor told us about sci courses and I will be enrolling again in the fall semester. I am dedicated to passing chemistry, as it is the only science I am truly struggling in. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,563,"I decided to enroll in this 1 unit course as a sort of precautionary measure. I know how difficult Chemistry 115 can be so I’m doing my best to stay on top of everything. Furthermore, the main reason why I’m taking this course is due to my major. I’m majoring in General Biology, which means I have a set number of mandated courses, which includes Chemistry 115 and Chemistry 215. Although I still have a ways to go, I plan to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in the next two years, apply to a Medical School (in or out of state) and slowly work my way to becoming an Anesthesiologist. Although it’s a long, difficult and challenging path to establishing a career in the medical field, I’m taking it day by day so I can focus on what San Francisco State University has to offer.In the end, I hope to leave this semester with a few more contacts/friendships in hopes that our paths will cross again."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,564,"Paul Saini  Chemistry 115  2/18/20  Chemistry 115               I am a Punjabi and I am from the Bay. My religion is Sikhism and I really am grateful that I am Sikh because it really accepts any person, no matter what race you are, gender, or anything. I have two sisters and I love my family; my parents are the main reason I’m in college because I want to support them in the future and provide for them like they did with me. I am a very shy person but I get used to talking to the people around me in a few days. My current goal for my life is to be a researcher, and to be honest I really don’t know what to yet. I want to explore anything in the biology department, but botany sounds like a great thing to start with. One of my motivations for doing well is probably my parents and wanting to make them proud. Back in high school I had fun in biology, and in the cell department actually, so that might be a second option for me. For a few months I was thinking to study RPT, (recreation, parks, and tourism), because that major seems very fun to me and with jobs it could come with. For researching as a biologist, I think it might be very hard but fun to do something that you are passionate about. For the RPT, I think it might be fun to do your job depending on your passion as well, but also there are a few well-paying jobs and I want to be able to provide for my family, I found this out from one of my professors I had for RPT. The researching in biology is awesome, for me I thought the environment conservation one is interesting. We need more people in this field because the earth is really a beautiful place and it really needs help. I just don’t know if all these biology courses would be great for me, I don’t really do well in math and if the major needs math I might struggle. But luckily botany doesn’t really need math, cell research also doesn’t need that much math as well. The forensic department sounds awesome because you work with the police and that would be great to help out at a crime scene and help the police. I want to explore during this class and see how an actually biologist does lab work during the labs, this will help me figure out if this is right for me. I would also like to see a botany advisor for some guidance and help on if that is a good option for me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,565,"When I first heard about the class introduced on the first day of the lecture, I think I would need it. I took CHEM110 in the past and it didn't have a class like that before. Chemistry is definitely not something that I am good at and it can be difficult and frustrating. In the past I always try to search online for more information or a different teaching method on the material that talked about in class, however, I think I am not a self-learn(?) person, and I feel like I learn better when in class and see example and explanation than reading a whole passage of words and try to comprehend. The second reason is that I think that I need this class because all the chemistry classes are held in the early morning, and most of the time I have difficulty sleeping early at night. As a result sometimes in the lecture, I am not able to process new information that quickly and clearly. with extra help and more explanation and practice would definitely help me.       "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,566,"To answer the question as to why I am here, it is for myself. My now self and my future self. I think it will be important the things I do now to help with future sceneries. I attend San Francisco State University to help my future self in my leading to my career. I am here as a role model to my sisters and to make my parents proud. I have seen struggle, within in my family and within my community, and I hope to help fix that struggle and help those who look like me. Something, a goal, I have always wanted for myself is to be financially stable and be able to comfortably provide for myself. I am here to make those before my proud, to show them that we can make it, that we are worth more than people perceive us as. I am here for an abundance of reasons, but again, it is mostly for myself. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,567,"I am here in this class because I need more help on Chem 115. Since it was my first time in this class, I enjoyed every bit of it how we can not be afraid to ask questions, and how you help us on our individual needs and encourage us and push us to do good in Chem 115. I also need chem 115 for grad school, so I hope I can get an A in the class. I've kind of fallen behind because the 8am lectures, I can barley retain information during that time or I will sometimes miss, so that is why I am taking SCI 115. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,568,"Why Am I Here? -Due to my challenges with the subject.Personally, chemistry has always been a difficult subject. Teachers make the difference, and my high school Honors Chem instructor made the subject challenging. Maura Concoran, my Chem 100 professor, made the subject much easier through her explanations and through attending office hours. I’m taking this Sci 115 course to guarantee studying for Chem 115 and to overall feel prepared for exams, homework, etc. Exams are my weakness and often stopped me from getting A’s. Hopefully this course will offer extra help."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,569,"Why Am I here? Didn't really count on SCI 115 to get this philosophical. I'd assume me being here has something to do with chemistry all the way down to the sub-atomic level. The Great Michael Choi describes interconnectedness between life and space to be something similar to Elmer's glue. Smart product placement to getting students high, grades. A cheap answer would say I'm here because, without you, the concepts of this class wouldn't stick. A clever answer would say something along the lines of petroleum, natural gas, and other raw materials. A stoner would say to get high. I won't lie, I'm here to bond with everyday life, and it's complexities. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,570,"Sydney Gonzalez-DeSantiago Feb. 28, 2020So the reason why I wanted to sign up for the sci courses is because I need help on the side line in order to refresh my skills from high school. So for chemistry I just want to relearn the basics because the last time I took chemistry was my junior year in high school. I like how this course is making me remember the little stuff I forget but also teaching me about stuff I really forgot about. For example hybridization levels. I completely forgot about those guys because it’s like so basic but yet important as one continues to build their chemistry skills as the courses get harder. The reason why I joined the calculus sci course is because I struggle in math. But both these are really good tutoring sessions because the students teaching know the tricks in order to survive the main course. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,571,"I'm in SCI 115 because I took chemistry last semester and ended up getting a D. I feel like there were many things that went wrong last semester like juggling extracurriculars was difficult in itself but personally I had a problem with the seminar component of the class specifically. I feel like the weekly quizzes were ineffective because my seminar section was before my lecture so the material on the quiz especially during the end of the semester hadn't been properly covered. Coupled with the fact that I didn't fully understand concepts I ended up failing like every single quiz. Also, seminar was pretty much individual/group work on packets and we never turned them in so I feel like having a seminar section was a whole waste of my time and it only brought my grade down. But im here to try to pass the class this semester, I feel good about this class."
