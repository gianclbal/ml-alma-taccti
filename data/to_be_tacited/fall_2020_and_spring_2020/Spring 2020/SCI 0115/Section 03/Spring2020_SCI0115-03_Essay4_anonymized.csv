2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,568,"How do forms of measurement, such as the SI unit system, apply to stoichiometric equations?In order to complete stoichiometric equations, conversion factors are needed. First one must check that their chemical equation is balanced, then the units of a given substance are converted to moles. Using the molar ratio, you can calculate the moles of substance yielded by the reaction and finally convert moles of the wanted substance to the desired units. There are two types of conversion factors that are used more often than others, the first being molar mass (or molecular weight), to convert between grams and moles of a single chemical. The second commonly used conversion factor would be coefficients from balanced equations, which are used to convert between moles of one chemical and moles of a different chemical. Professor Choi provides a simplified example of how stoichiometry is used when cooking. In the lesson, it is displayed through the use of ingredients needed to make a grilled cheese sandwich. The equation for the sole purpose of this example would be, “2 pieces of bread + 3 slices of cheese = 1 grilled cheese sandwich Once you know what ingredients are needed and their amounts, you are then able to determine how much of a product can be made based on available ingredients."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,564,"Stoichiometry is hard but useful. Why is stoichiometry used? It is used in many ways in real life and mainly it would be in labs. Research labs that use chemicals or maybe finding how to measure something new. If in real life we need to balance an equation then we can with stoichiometry, if you need to find the mole ratio then your could use it too. This information can help scientists do their work and be able to accurately or approximately calculate an equation. Society can benefit with this by making new equations to solve and figuring them out o make the world a better place and furthering science. Sometimes chemistry could be useful for making food and knowing what to mix. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,570,"So my question might seem board and kinda something that a lot of  students have felt before when having to take chemistry, but it's a true thought and there is a reason as to  why I must ask this question. Why do we have to learn chemistry? Yes it  is board but listen, or read, for a quick second. See this question  relates as to the whole concept of how most concepts we learn in the  class can be used in the real world without even knowing it. For  starters, the definition I found as to why chemistry is important is  because everything we do in our lives involves some form of chemistry. Our body is constantly doing multiple chemical reactions plus it is made out of atoms and elements found on the periodic table which we have also learned at the beginning of the semester. See the first few lectures of this class taught us chemical reactions which we can then reflect them to ourselves when we breathe, eat, or just sit at our desk reading this reflection question. Then another simple correlation to chemistry is that everything all around us is made of matter, another big lecture that Prof. Michael taught as his first class. So the very importance of chemistry is that it's the study of everything. Also chemistry can be seen as the central science because it connects other sciences to each other, such as the following biology, physics, geology, and environmental science just to name a few. And if you want to go even further into how chemistry is used in the real world look at the wonders of medicine. Learning even the basic or most complex knowledge of chemistry helps us to read and understand much about our own bodies and nature when dealing with chemicals."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,567,One was stoichemistry. You could use it in your daily lives by calculating/converting forms of SI units. This could be applied to like baking or if you travel to a different country that uses different units.
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,565,"I think stoichiometry would be one of the concepts that are helpful and would benefit society. Stoichiometry is the quantitative relationship between species in a reaction. One of the examples related to stoichiometry would be cooking. In the cooking process, we would need to have the number of ingredients to make certain food or things. And in using this or applying the concept to cooking it would be helpful. In using this way, it would make reaction stable and you know what would be the outcome. The term stoichiometric amount is the amounts found using molar ration. It was referred to the amount of reactant required or product formed."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,563,"My question focuses on the concept of solubility. During one of our weekly lab sessions, we were given the task of creating four solutions from what we were given. To start, we were supplied with one aqueous reagent and three solid reagents. In groups, we worked through each step listed in the manual and found the ‘Molar Mass/Concentration of the Reagent’, it’s mass/volume and gained an understanding of how to make solutions. However, my lingering question focuses on the process of solubility in our daily lives. For instance, “What examples of gases in the water do you see in your everyday life? What are some other examples?”. After looking through my notes, I was surprised to find that carbonated drinks are a prime example of this process. As stated in Henry’s Law, the amount of gas dissolved in a liquid solvent depends on the pressure applied to the gas, meaning that a high quantity of pressure will lead to more of the gas being dissolved into the water. Furthermore, a common example of the solubility process is when you stir sugar into your cup of coffee. By mixing a soluble item, like sugar, in the coffee, we create a new solution. Moreover, I find this information to be incredibly useful to our society because when we are prescribed medication we trust that the pharmaceutical scientists fully understand the process of solubility, or else we run the risk of having a high concentration that could be fatal if ingested. As a result, this kind of information proves to be important not only to society but to us, the future doctors of tomorrow."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,562,"Question: What are the endothermic and exothermic processes? Describe each of them.  I learned about the endothermic and exothermic processes in our lecture on thermochemistry which is the study of the heat involved in reactions, and specifically it involves looking at the heat absorbed and the heat released in chemical and physical changes. Thermochemistry relates to endothermic and exothermic processes which both involve heat. Endothermic is the process in which heat is absorbed while exothermic is the process in which heat is released. This relates to the real world because we deal with both processes in everyday life without even really thinking about it. In the endothermic process, this includes examples such as sweat evaporating (even when the human body is exercising), water boiling (cooking food such as pasta), cooking an egg, baking bread, even photosynthesis which is important in plant life. Endothermic processes eventually create a cooling effect, and this is important for example when exercising, your body will release sweat to lower your temperature so that your body does not overheat. Exothermic examples include combustion reactions, respiration, freezing water, or a candle burning. It is important when classifying a process as exothermic or endothermic, watch how the temperature of the surroundings changes. An exothermic process releases heat and causes the temperature of the immediate surroundings to rise. An endothermic process absorbs heat and cools the surroundings."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,566,"Question: How are ""concentrated"" solutions and ""diluted"" solutions part of our everyday lives?To answer this question, we could say pretty much everyday we encounter ""concentrated"" solutions and ""diluted"" solutions. In terms of ""concentrated"" solutions, which is a solution high in concentration. Which then means that something is saturated and no longer dissolves because there is ""too much"" of that that is trying to be dissolved. For example, adding too much salt or too much sugar to the point that it no longer dissolves is a saturated solution. Another saturated solution that many do not really think to be a saturated solution is carbonated water. The ""too much"" aspect of carbonated water is the carbon, hence the give off of carbon through the bubbles. Now in terms of ""diluted"" solutions, which are solutions low in concentration. So the opposite of ""concentrated"" solutions. These solutions dissolve with no problem because they have lower concentration than the maximum. The examples in relation to this are a little more closer to what we are used to. For example, when we add sugar to our coffee. The sugar is able to dissolve because it is just the right amount, not ""too much"". Another example would be adding salt to hot water, which is mostly used to garggle when one has a sore throat. The heat from the water makes dissolving the salt a easier. "
