2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,565,"For the question that asked for this week, I think we will be fairly familiar with struggles especially when we in college and with a bunch of school work and any personal issue that we have at this time. I think personally when things get challenging I would need to slow down and if possible I would stop working on the stuff that I have and take a break from work. To reduce stress I like to watch shows that I like even if I had watched it many times. I think it can also be a way to relax from stressing out in school work. Other than that I think listening to music also would help to release stress. I like to listen to music at night time before I go to bed, I think it is a time that we need to relax and let the brain stop worrying too much about all the stuff that is going on. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,562,"When life gets challenging, I like to take time to reflect on myself. I ask myself “Why was I put into the situation, do I have control over it, and how can I grow from it.” I also like to take time to do things that I enjoy such as walking my dog, listening to music, going out with friends, or reading. Balance is very important for me when life gets hectic so taking steps toward self-care is crucial. Also, when life gets challenging, I always tell myself that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, the hard situation that I am in wont last forever and it will soon pass. I also find ways to relieve stress such as cooking or aromatherapy. There will always be a point in my life where I will be challenged and although it may become stressful, Its always important to look at the bigger picture and never give up."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,570,"When life gets challenging the first thing I do is distance myself from others. I prefer to be alone for a while and try to catch up on life however best I can. So when that happens I tend to distract myself with music, poetry, books, and drawing. But if life is getting to challenging, then I look to a friend that I can trust and who can listen to me rant and help me out as best as they can. Otherwise I'm on my own for a while till my friends notice how quiet I've been. So yea I think that's what I can best describe what I do when life is getting challenging or in the case of COVID 19, kinda getting stressful. With online exams being a bit odd and having to teach yourself the material if one does not understand the posted lecture."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,567,"When life gets challenging, I like to go off on my own and I think to myself. I think about what is hard and what can I do to make it easier. I come up with a plan to over come what is hard. Then I take it one step at a time, kind of like problem solving. I will also ask my friends and peers around me for help. I will also go to study hours and talk to the teacher about the course and how they can help me. I will then study in the library and i will stop going out and just keep going to the library till I get the subject. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,563,"When life gets challenging, I tend to ignore it. I try to be as productive as possible whether it’s cleaning my apartment, working on assignments or getting a head start on future assignments. The only time I ever acknowledge how difficult life is is when I’m laying in bed. At that point I start to think about my meaningless existence. A few scenarios of this ‘downtime’ occur when I listen to sad/mellow music, make music/beats, hang with friends, or scroll through twitter. I’m not sure how effective this method is but it seems to be a temporary solution to a long term issue. From what I can remember, I’ve been using this style of managing since highschool.Moreover, I joined a few clubs to help my antisocial self branch out just a little bit more. Although it doesn’t sound like any sort of coping method to the difficulties of life, I somehow see it as one of the most calming options. For instance, when I force myself to attend a social gathering I eventually feel relieved because I pushed myself to overcome that silly fear. In a way, it’s relaxing to know that I have the potential to be in control when it feels like I’m suffocating. By doing something as simple as joining a club, I’m giving myself the chance to grow."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,571,"Usually when life gets challenging I start to journal my feelings. I like to keep a notebook where I tell my funny stories, warmest memories, what's bothering me, and so on and so forth. At first it was hard to write because I was afraid of judgement but I kept sticking with it and realized that really nobody would be judging what I'm saying because (theoretically) no one would be seeing it and that automatically makes me feel 1,000 times much better. I think having a space to vent is super useful and it's  one of the many things I think everyone should do. I haven't journaled since last semester because I haven't sat and taken the time to and when that happens I usually just talk to my best friend because she always knows what to say. If I for some reason can't do either of those things I try to ground myself and try to channel my frustrations into something a little more productive. For example, I usually stress about school and so instead of sitting there in anguish I try to work on what I'm stressed about even though it can be a double edged sword sometimes."
