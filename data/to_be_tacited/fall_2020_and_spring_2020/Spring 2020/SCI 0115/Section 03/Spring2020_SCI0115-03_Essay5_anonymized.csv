2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,567,I want to go into my major because I really like kinesiology. I want to become a future P.A. so that means I have to go get my masters and go to even more schooling. I want to help people when Im older and to also help doctors and nurses. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,562,"I chose my major nutritional science because I love to study how food affects the body scientifically. I believe that nutrition is a science and with the proper nutrients, the United States diseases that are caused by the food that we eat. I am also going into my major because I want to be able to help other people make better choices when it comes to their diet. Nutrition is not only physically but its also emotional and cultural, there are many factors that contribute to why we eat what we eat. My goal is to become a Registered Dietitian and possibly continue to get my PhD in medical nutrition therapy. What motivates me in my science classes is by being positive and to always look at the bigger picture. It may be a tough road, but I know this is what I want, and I’m going to have to work hard to get there."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,569,"""Why do I want to go into my major?""Choosing is major was not easy. There are so many insightful avenues. It gets overwhelming very quickly. I've dabbled with Economics, Biology, Philosophy, and Physics, each a unique discipline that is worth the time to explore but not enough to dedicate my college career. It wasn't until the spring of the sophomore year I was introduced to the study of death with an anthropological approach. I finally found that calling I was looking for, Anthropology. Anthropolgy aligns with the drive to know more, a possible research project I'm deeply interested in. (The cross-section of American born Indian population) and death! I want to take some time to explore the peace corp, so the study of culture fits in this as well—all while also satisfying pre-med requirements and exploring other inter disciplines that much intrigue me. Anthropology is the holistic major of study I was looking for! "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,564,"Some of the main reasons i like my major is so i can do something that makes my parents proud and so that i could have fun doing my job. I really like biology and i don't know yet really what major i should focus on but for now it is cell and micro biology. I want to go into my major to i could make my parents proud of the profession that i will have. I don't have many family members that are scientists so i want to be something different and not another engineer. I've contemplated from leaving my major and going into RPT (recreational, parks, and tourism) which i took a critical thinking class for my first semester and i think that this might be the time to decide before its too late. The main reason of wanting that class is because it could be awesome and it was so interesting and fun to learn about and to participate in the class. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,566,"""Why do I want to go into my major?"" The reason I have chosen to major in pre-biology is because I have always known that I wanted to work in a field revolving around the human body. I find the human body to be very intriguing and complex. Being a person of color, I have witnessed other people of color having higher rates of illnesses. Therefore, I want to work in something that I can do to help my people. Being in the medical field I will have the chance to work hands on and help them directly. They do not always have familiar faces helping them when they seek the help. They rarely have people who understand their struggles, so that is the familiarity I would want to be. Plus, being a girl in STEM is a big deal. I will soon be a part of the growing percent of Latina women graduating college and leading a job in the STEM field."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,563,"My plan is to graduate from San Francisco State University and find a job in the medical field. In an ideal situation, I would apply to a medical school in this state, enroll, and work through years of schooling to become an Anesthesiologist. However, if that dream doesn’t come true, my backup plan is to become a researcher and preferably study the Autism Spectrum Disorder. I would want to specifically study this disorder because of my brother. 	Moreover, from a young age, I knew I wanted to work in the medical field. Thanks to my mom’s dedication to raising a kid on her own and still having the drive to accomplish her dreams of becoming a Chief Nursing Officer (CNO), I immediately knew I wanted to be just like her. I wanted to help others and one day work with her. In the end, I’m not sure where the next few years will take me but I hope that whatever I decide to do brings me happiness."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,568,"My major is Communicative Disorders, which I chose with the hope of becoming a Speech Language Pathologist. As of now, I got accepted into San Diego State University and will be transferring in the fall of 2020. There the major is called Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences, but overall my goal remains the same. Although I have just started taking courses that will apply to the major, being a part of the department has broadened my perspective on career options. If I do not pursue pathology, I would like to become an Audiologist. My choice of major is inspired by having a brother with autism and seeing the work of speech therapists from a young age. Due to my mother being a nurse, I was always been encouraged to go into the medical field; however, I never saw myself in the traditional roles of being a nurse, doctor, etc. I’ve had the opportunity of shadowing my mom at work and could not see myself in that position. This made me determined to pursue a career where I could still help others while catering to my interests. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,565,"At first, I wanted to major in a nursing major but it got really competitive and then I changed it to Nutrition major. The point to that is I want to major in something that would help me in the future or when I want to go back to the nursing major. In my opinion, I think nutrition majors can be very beneficial. In this way, people can have a better diet and improve their health. It is more important that people need to take care of their health and their diet. Learning all the information and knowledge would also help me know about all the things about food. I can use all this information to help people. I was struggling with choosing a psychology major or nutrition major. I think they both are beneficial and related to the nursing majors. I choose nutrition major since I think it would be easier than psychology. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,570,"My major that I'm currently working towards is microbiology. See ever since I was five years old I knew I wanted to become a doctor one day and that is still my dream. As I grew up my love for science intensified but I still didn't knew what types of branches the basic biology, chemistry, and physics could offer until I got into high school. It was there that I began to love biology out of the other two main sciences. It was also in AP Bio I learned that there were multiple branches that dealt with the body internal systems thus rerouting me towards learning about microbiology. Which makes sense because I want to know what exactly is happening at the microscopic levels of many different organisms in the animal kingdom but specifically humans. So therefore I also still want to expand my knowledge of microbiology to studying virology or epidemiology since its another sub branch of micro."
