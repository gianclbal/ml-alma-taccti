2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,562,"My values of my family have helped me navigate through college because they 100% support all my academic goals. My mother especially has helped me study for my science courses as well as my aunt who is a nurse, and my father and siblings are constantly checking up on me and making sure that I have all the resources I need to succeed in my courses. The values of my community inspire me to also be in school. I have come such a long way after being in community college and I know that I could not have done it without my family’s support. They make me stronger each day. I want to become a registered dietitian mostly to help low income communities that do not have the resources to eat healthier. This is important to me because my community raised me, and I would love to someday give back to them."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,564,"My families values of education and how hard my parents work for me to have a great education is what pushes me to do well in my classes. They work hard to pay off my college tuition so that i could have a better life than they had and so that i could be happy and successful in the future. Another thing that helps me through college is what my sisters told me when i was young, ""make friends and be successful in the future."" This helped me so i could get other peoples opinions for classes and get help from them if i needed. Being able to socialize and being able to ask questions helps me to grow further and learn more. Something else that i value is when i feel like giving up i can rely on what my sister does, ""the faster i get it done the faster i can be having fun"" and anyway i should just be having fun with my studies because i chose biology for a reason, and its because i like it a lot."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,569,"""How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?""My family is always here for support. I could rely on them for financial, education, or guidance. Most of my close friends are wonderful individuals who are also there for emotional support. In addition, my sister is always there for a joyful time, with so much energy it's always fun to play games or even annoy her. Together my community is a strong core to my wellbeing and success. Altogether I can make choices about my education or college without having to worry too much about the outcomes. Transferring universities is my biggest priority and it's been easier with understanding individuals in my life helping me adults to constantly change. My friends from another university also fill me in on the new environments I'm walking into whether it's a study group at a different school, or a different school itself. Friends serve as pillars of guidance as well. Finally, I would be remiss to not address the SCI community along with its mentors. Always there to help with a great attitude, I'm truly grateful to have these individuals in my life! "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,570,"Coming from a Hispanic background, my parents have always pushed me  to strive better than what they did during their adolescent and young  adulthood life. Especially since my grandparents tried to provide a  better life for their kids when coming to the states and then returning  back to their homeland. My parents tried to provide me with  possibilities that could better improve my overall educational career.  Throughout my whole life they've tried their best to get me where I'm  at, even though it's not where I wanted to be but I can make the best of  college and still strive to get into a good med school. So in  conclusion my parents have always been a good guide in navigating me  towards college. As well as the value of family is another key strength that has also help me navigate through college. See in my culture family is everything, we take care of the youngest all the way to the eldest and always try our best to provide to those in need in our ginormous family. If I or my family ever needed something we have each others back and try our best to be there for the other."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,567,"For me the values I learned from my community is that not a lot of kids go to college, usually drop out of high school or graduate high school and then just get a job right out of high school. For me that was different, when I got accepted into college that made me feel special and value my education enough to want to further it. My family has pushed me through college and is my backbone through it all. I am a first generation from an immigrant family. So this means a lot. I want to make a difference in the world. I want to support my family in the future and pave the stone for my younger siblings. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,568,"The values of my peers influenced and helped in my college pathway, as well as personal mentors such as my mom, teachers, etc. Unfortunately, I cannot say that my family or community overall were supportive since many strictly encouraged the community college route. Being a first-generation college student has also brought its own challenges. My family is very work-oriented and did not quite understand the overall benefits of attending a 4-year University. With my goal of becoming a Speech Pathologist, I would need to get my Masters in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences. Since it is now my second-year, my family has witnessed the progress I've made and is now really supportive of my decision. Although this has been a challenge, I am proud that I am one of the few cousins in my family to be attending a University and that I will be able to provide advice to my younger cousins/nieces and nephews in the future."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,566,"I grew up in East Side San Jose and attended schools filled with people who looked like me and came from similar backgrounds like mine. I grew up in a family where my dad only attended school up until the fourth grade and a mom who graduated high school. Both my parents are very hard working people and did everything they could to provide for my siblings and I. My brothers attended continuation school and almost did not graduate high school. I am the first born girl so the pressure on me to do good in school, I feel was a little harder coming from a latino family background. All through grade school I always knew I wanted to attend college so I always did my best to do good in school. At some point it some being a pressure thing and more of a personal goal. I saw how my parents struggled and I wanted to do everything I could do make them proud, to give back to them everything they gave me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,563,"The values that my family instilled in me at a young age continue to guide every decision I make.  For example, every day after elementary school I would spend three to four hours waiting for my mom to pick me up at my grandparent’s house. With that much free time, my grandmother decided it best to help me through my homework. Though we would constantly bicker over the assigned homework problems, I still remember those special moments when she would talk about college and the importance of education. Though I was just a kid, I can still remember the feeling of how adamant she was on me going to college. I knew I didn’t want to let my grandmother down. 	As I started my freshman year at San Francisco State University, I expected to keep the values my grandmother worked so hard to drill into my head but as I spent more and more time in such an accepting community, I developed a set of values that still prioritizes my schooling but also lets me explore who I am and what I want out of life. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,3,571,"My family/community values are what drives me in life. Like many other first generation children of immigrants my goal in life is to return everything my parents sacrificed and gave to me tenfold. The Latinx community often gets ridiculed yet we remain resilient. That’s really the most powerful thing you can be and during my undergraduate career I’ve had many ups and downs. They paint a college career to be straightforward, ‘You’ll be taking so and so many classes and x amount of units each semester’  but unexpected things happen all the time so being resilient is one of the qualities I most admire having. There’s nothing that can hold you down if you know you can always pick yourself up and dust yourself off. My family has always instilled in me the value of education so taking things seriously in school is another thing that helps me navigate higher education. I’m a different person in the classroom meaning I’m here with a purpose. Despite all my challenges I know I can earn this degree with the values I have carried with me throughout my whole life."
