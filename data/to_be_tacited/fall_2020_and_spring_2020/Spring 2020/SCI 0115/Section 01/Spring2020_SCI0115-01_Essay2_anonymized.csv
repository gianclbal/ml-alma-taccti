2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,543,"Kimberly Ramirez February 24, 2020Life is all about challenge. It’s about overcoming obstacles, big or small, which can have an impact on you. My life is a challenge, as far as I am concerned. When talking in terms of health, I have had challenges with my breathing and digesting foods. Whenever that happens, I reminded myself that doctors and other health professionals have always supported me in times of need, and the treatments I am doing can help lessen the pain that I have suffered. In terms of my education, I have always excelled in academics and received awards. But I still get stressed when I tend to not perform as well as I would like to in a certain situation. In this case, I cam myself down by breathing in and out, and clearing my head of every worst-case scenario that I might overthink about. I have also downloaded a quotes app which, every day, sends me inspirational quotes and gives me satisfaction on what lies ahead for the day. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,548,What I do when life gets challenging is to ask for help from the people that I know are there to support me. They usually know what to say to help get me back on track. When I’m also struggling I turn to my community at school I have this advisor who is the sweetest and always helps me when I’m at my worst and I just don’t know what to do with myself. There’s just a lot of people I reach out to now since I realized it’s okay and that I’m not the only one that is going through similar problems. When I’m struggling with classes as well I try to use as many resources like my friends or tutors but I also take it upon myself to get to know the material well so that I can succeed. I look at videos or examples that are online to get me to learn better concepts sometimes it ends up benefiting me a lot because I find short cuts and easier ways to memorize topics.
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,545,"What I do when life gets challenging when it’s either personal or just school/work related is I just don’t care. I just don’t care what happens and I just try to ignore most of the stress so I can do what needs to be done. Because on how I see it is if I start caring and get stressed out or get depressed that’s how it gets worse. And it will only make what you are trying to do harder for yourself for no reason. And at least for me it works most of the time, although there are times where that fails and that’s when it’s really bad and I can get it out of my mind I try to do something it could be any task. Such as watching videos taking notes on lecture slides online. Just so I have something to do and keep my mind from getting stressed or depressed."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,553,"As someone who was dealt with clinical depression as well as generalized anxiety disorder, I have a hard time dealing with the lows in my life. When things get challenging, I tend to break down and then struggle to pick up all of the pieces I’ve scattered around. However, with the help of therapy as well as medication, dealing with these depressive episodes has become a lot less destructive. Currently, my process of problem solving involves taking a step back and looking at the entire problem. Recently I was pulled over after work because of a broken headlight, which I was aware of but unable to pay the repair costs of. Instead of issuing me a warning, the officer wrote me a citation. I then proceeded to have a panic attack that lasted until 5 am. Due to this, I skipped all of my Monday classes last week. Once I was able to calm myself down, I sat down and started working on a budget that will fit the bills I currently have to pay as well as car repairs and credit card payments. After establishing a set goal to have over $5000 in savings by the end of September, I was able to relax and understand how budgeting works. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,547,"I don’t handle challenging situations very well. I definitely have been getting better at it, like trying to reroute my stress in other ways. I feel like when times get tough I don’t fry hard enough to make things better. Instead of finding solutions I just complain about my problems. And I do realize that’s the problem, that’s the reason why I have anxiety. It’s because I don’t help my self at all. For example, if I know I have a hard test coming up, i don’t study until the day before. I’m surprised I have been able to make it this far by doing it, I mean it shows in my grades for sure, but I’m surprised I haven’t failed any classes. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,531,"When life gets challenging the first thing I do is usually cry, I'm such an emotional person. I like to let it all out. Life commonly gets challenging because I get stressed out really easily which causes me to cry. I usually like to get it out of my system because anything will trigger my emotions from keeping them in. Anyways, so after I cry I like to regroup myself and tackle one thing at a time. I try to make a list of all the things that are causing me stress at the moment. Then I figure out how to go about each problem. I also like to be active when life gets challenging. I go on walks and go to the gym. This is probably my least favorite coping mechanism, but sleeping helps too. I'm a sleeping queen. Venting out to one of my housemates does the job too. It's nice to have reassurance or to be told that everything is going to be okay. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,550,"When life gets challenging for me I try to solve my problems through the means of how likely things are to happen in the future. By that I mean, I think about how likely I am to stick to a certain method, or if my work or time is valued in what I'm doing. So when something challenges me, I figure out how to tackle it without taking the most losses on my end. As long as I can accomplish the task, that is the goal. So I get less sleep, spend less time on things I like to do, find shortcuts/alternatives to help my workload, etc. I'm a bit of a problem solver If I do say so myself. But lastly, my mindset is, the world is out to get me so I expect less in the first place so I'm not surprised and I prepare for the worst."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,549,"What I do when life gets challenging depends on my state of mind. Sometimes in order for me to get over my anxiety about the challenge that I am facing, I have to remind myself that I have gotten over things in the past. Life is full of ups and downs and as a person that is currently attending college, its a good reminder to set in order for me to move forward. I have in the past turned to substance abuse in order for me to ignore the problems in my life. Besides the fact that life would be boring without its challenges, I look at it as a chance to become a wiser, more experienced version of myself instead of a jaded individual. I mean it also matters if you look at it in a negative or positive way. I choose to be an optimist because pessimism has prevented me from growing or overcoming problems. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,552,"When life gets challenging I tend to just stop whatever is causing me stress and just relax, whether thats through watching watching tv, going out into nature, and etc. there is always going to be times when life gets hard and it is all about powering through it. it is not good to just give up when life gets hard because then you will get nowhere in life. persevering through the hardships is what builds character. although i stop what i am doing to take a break i still keep the same mentality of completing what i have started because giving up is worse than trying but not succeeding. i often give myself a short break where i can take my mind off the stressful activity and then jump right back into it. that has really helped me because it allows me to have time to think and reflect of the tough situations.    "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,542,"When life gets challenging, I usually do one of two things. I either run away or just fight through it and do my best. It depends on if there is a choice to run away or do it later. If it's an assignment or a future exam I would either procrastinate or leave it to the last week to study or look over my notes. I would attend class and take better notes and things like that but if its a challenge where there is no future due dates, it's a decision or thing right at the moment I would just face it and accept the consequences. A nap helps too. If it's an assignment or long paper to write I usually nap for a while first or halfway through just to destress. I don't tend to get stress on things I cannot control like other's actions or behavior. Naps helps with everything. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,554,"What I do when life gets challenging is sit back and reflect. I think about whats giving me a hard and think about how I can changes things and work harder to make it a difference if I face this challenge again so it wont be difficult the next time. Another thing I do is talk to my roommates and ask for advice if they have faced this challenge before in life or just their opinion and just see what they would do. I also frequently call home to my mother, sister, or auntie who give me some of the best advice I can ask for when I need help. They are definitely my best problem solvers and made my time at San Francisco State a lot easier when I was lost. Another thing I do is watch youtube videos on my favorite youtubers and use it as an escape while watching videos and forget about whats going on for that short period of time."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,338,"When life gets tough I take the time to reflect on my feelings. I take the time that I need to honor how I am feeling to be able to move forward in a healthy and healing way. Personally, when times get tough I engage in a number of outlets or activities that foster self-care. For example, I pull on my support system (ie. school organization, family, friends outside of academia, lab friends) and I do activities that I know will lift my spirits. When life is challenging I am blessed to be able to depend on my support system. For example, I have been part of a student organization on campus called Clinica Martin Baro. I have been part of this organization for over 4 years. With this in mind, I have developed a close bond and network of close friends. We all have a common goal to create equity for marginalized groups and we also share life experiences. When I am going through some personally trying times, I know I can always count on my extended Clinica Familia. Additionally, I go to a workout class called Body Combat. This class really supports my mental health and helps me get through feelings of worry, depression or anxiety. All things considered, these are some of the things that help me through difficult times."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,333,"When life gets challenging ill usually find a way to solve problems by myself first. I always like to try to work things out by myself before I ask others for help because I feel like I learn the most by making mistakes and correcting them by myself. However, I also acknowledge that I don't know everything and I can always learn from others. Usually, I'll ask my mom, parents, family for help. My mom is a very wise person and really knows how to cope with difficult situations, so when ever life gets hard I'll usually come to her because she can calm me down. If I still need more advise I'll go to close friends who know the subject,  if it has to do with school. If I still don't understand something or if my life is still being tried/challenged I'll ask my peers, teachers. However, I feel like during the years I have developed a pretty good support system and taken the stress out of my life tremendously by not surrounding myself with people who have bad intentions, or bad energy. When life gets hard I know the people around me are there to support me in anyway that they can and that's why I usually never feel stuck."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,316,"Life is full of wonderful things, but unfortunately there are also downs that we experience and must go through, as it is a part of life. By no means am I perfect, but at this point in my life I feel as though I have figured out a formula to ease my mind when life gets challenging. The first thing I do is identify the problem. Then I honestly think through whether or not I can fix the problem. If it is something I cannot fix, then I have to remind myself to relax, what is done is done, and I have to move forward. Moving forward can be extremely difficult in some situations, but it is crucial to getting into a better place overall. On the other hand, if there is something I can do about the problem then I list out the different possible outcomes/solutions. The important thing is to take every challenge in life as a lesson in order to learn and grow as a person, which we continue to do throughout the rest of our lives. Furthermore, some activities I like to do when life gets challenging is working out at the gym. I can release all my built up stress, and I always leave with a clearer head."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,546,"I feel as though my first reaction to a challenge in life is to isolate myself. In that alone time, I cry, write, or think on my own. Sometimes that step by itself is healing and I actually work through my emotions well. However, most of the time, I find myself even more depressed and make it more difficult for myself to get out of that state. What I do when I seem stuck is I rely on those closest with me. I realized that keeping everything bottled in is not healthy for me. I become sad and angry towards everyone. I talk to my dad about a lot of my problems and I know there is little judgment from him. I used to hide everything from him. but as I grew older and we started to understand each other more, I started opening up to him about everything. I also try to talk to my closest friends who are understanding and will keep my secrets to themselves. I also pray when it seems like I cannot find any answer to my problems anywhere."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,544,"When life gets challenging I honestly just sleep my problems away even though it is not a good thing to do. Whenever life gets hard for me i like to have a distraction to forget about my problems for while like go out with friends. I honestly don't do much when life gets challenging. I used to go on long walks and free my mind and just enjoy the peace and quiet so i can figure out steps on what to do when life gets challenging. If I can't figure out a situation i usually go ask someone else for a second opinion. When life hits me hard I end up taking multiple naps in a day, but I am trying to think of new methods like exercising or even mediating because I heard those really help especially with your mental health it makes it better. I don't always want to sleep around because it makes me have no motivation to do anything else in life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,551,"When life gets challenging I pray and I take deep breaths. I know that I am not a super hero, and I can only complete one thing at a time. I also can only do the best that I can. I try not to compare myself to others. This helps a lot. I am also kind to myself. I notice that when I do this, my mood is a lot more positive. I wake up happy and I am more positive throughout my day. I also look to my loved ones for support. I explain to them how I feel and most of the time, just talking to them, makes me feel better. I know that life gets overwhelming, but if I take the proper me time, I know that I can overcome anything. Journaling also helps me, along with exercising. I also love talking with my mom as well. "
