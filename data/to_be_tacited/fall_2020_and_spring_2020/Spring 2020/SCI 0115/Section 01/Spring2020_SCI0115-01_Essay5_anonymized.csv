2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,553,"I am a microbiology major. I chose this major because I believed it would give me the clearest path towards a PhD for genetic engineering. In 7th grade, we learned about Gregor Mendel and his peas. suddenly, a light bulb went off inside my head and I knew I wanted to work with genetics. Later on in high school, the genetics lecture focused more on cell division and how DNA is passed down from parent to offspring. Genetic diseases or malformations became my biggest interest, and my dream job today is still the same as it was my freshman year of high school. I want to work with CRISPR and help people. My roommate has Type 1 Diabetes, so his pancreas doesn't create insulin to regulate his blood sugar. CRISPR Therapeutics is currently working on a regenerative medicines by combining CRISPR and STEM cells to treat diabetes. My goal is to find noninvasive ways in which we can more effectively treat or even cure diseases caused by genetics, such as blood diseases (sickle cell, hemophilia...), possible cancers, cystic fibrosis, and more.   "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,543,"Kimberly RamirezPicking a major can be difficult. For the first couple of years of college, you have the freedom to take classes for your general education and then explore your horizons so you can decide what you want to do for a career. After a lot of thinking over the years, I have decided to major in marine biology because I have always had a hidden but passionate interest in science. Living in California, home to some of the richest and more diverse waters in the world, has given me a sense of curiosity that I hadn’t felt before. My childhood involved watching nature documentaries again and again, and thinking of questions about why organisms survive the way they do. There is something about the ocean that is a big mystery. While 70% of Earth is water, we know more about outer space than we do about the ocean. There should be a new time for research and exploration to unlock the mysteries of the deep, and I would be more than happy to be a part of it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,338,"I want to pursue this major because I genuinely enjoy it. After receiving my Bachelor's in Psychology I still wanted to understand  the large intersectionality with mental health and physical health outcomes. This aspect really struck me and quickly shifted my career trajectory. I then wanted to understand the underpinnings of trauma and its impact on the physical body. With this in mind, that is when I decided to pursue a Master's in Cell and Molecular Biology in hopes of getting the research experience I need but also to hopefully find a key outlet in discovery for my future research interests."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,550,"I want to go into my major hopefully to study specific animals I'm personally interested in for the betterment of sustainability. When I was younger I was devastated that you actually can't legally have a pet Sugar Glider or Ferret in California. I did some research and the actual reason for this is because environmentalists aren't actually sure how (if gotten loose or set free into the current ecosystem of Califonia) they would positively or negatively affect it. And while you'd think, ""Why don't they just study the animals then?"" Well, they would but, there are economic cuts towards animal research since Trump's presidency. So I felt, if no one was going to do the work, I would personally for these animals I'm passionate about, and ones that may be more critical to our current time as well. I just want to help the survival of animals when companies would like to build in certain areas as well."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,549,"My major is Biology: Concentration in Physiology and it is a exciting major because I am taking classes such as anatomy that really delves into the human body and its functions. It is really important to learn about the human body and its functions for the purpose of research. I want to go into my major because I want to increase my knowledge of the human body and its complexities to go into research. I want to be a part of the researchers that work together not use their knowledge to find cures for diseases. I want to give back and help the less fortunate that were born with diseases and I want to be a contributor for them to eventually do the research and develop a treatment for them to live a normal life. I think it is a human necessity to be able to be able to breathe, laugh, and live a normal life. I understand that being a Biology major is difficult but I am willing to try my hardest and take sci classes on difficult classes and chemistry has proven to be a difficult class. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,544,"At first I wanted to be a biology major, but once I took a biology class I realized that i was not really interested in it. So after finishing taking my general education classes I decided to change my major to kinesiology. Once I took a few KIN classes thats when I realized i wanted to learn more about the human body and how it functions in different ways. When I took these classes it also made me want to take better care of my body, not just eating healthy but also exercising it out because before I did not really care about my body. I would always eat junk food or fast food all the time and barely workout. I'm still learning about the different bones inside the body and the functions for it. I barely started working out in my home and when I am doing the exercises i learn more about specific bones and how it helps your body improve the body. I am still not sure what kind of career i want to do with a kinesiology major, but i hope to inform people about the human body."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,316,"I switched majors this year from business to biology because I really did not enjoy business, and saw no future in it. I plan on graduating from SFSU with a major in Biology (with a concentration in physiology) and a minor in Business. Afterwards, I plan on continuing school and becoming a PA. I am currently interested in surgical PA, specifically orthopedics. I can speak from personal experience because last year my mom had surgery on her leg. She had such a good experience with my surgeon and the rest of the medical team that I became really interested in surgery, and began my endless research. This is my main motivation for PA. Other careers that interest me would be a medical doctor (specifically dermatologist) or a dentist. This semester I was planning on shadowing a doctor my family knows to get a better feel for the hospital setting. However, with the current situation I am unable to, but I hope to continue with this plan when things get better and safer. When things do look out I hope to go into that shadowing experience with a very open mind to different occupations and specifics that might be of great interest to me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,546,"I realized I wanted to go into nursing when I was in high school. I always remember the first three reasons why I wanted it to be my major and my career. First was this boy named Elijah I took care of every Sunday at my old church's nursery. He had a lot of health issues since the day he was born and was in the NICU a lot. Despite the many surgeries and the never-ending problems he had, he was always my favorite kid to take care of. I wanted to be able to help babies and kids like Elijah. The second reason comes from my high school's nursing assistant ROP class. When we did our internships at nursing homes and getting real life experience, I had such a joy meeting and taking care of the residents. It was definitely hard at times and facing new challenges was a bit strange but I loved the experience. I got to form relationships with the NA's and the residents. The last reason was this medical/dental trip I went to in the Philippines one summer. We worked in busy villages and towns, it was very chaotic most of the time. The sense of peace really came from the nurses. They were able to calm down people's nerves and bring them comfort amongst very hectic and scary situations. I want to be able to provide that same kind of peace and comfort to people. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,548,I want to go into my major because I want to be able to help people that are in need of medical help in low income communities. I really enjoy working in the clinical fields and being able to help kids. Currently I work with kids on the autism spectrum and I really love it. This makes me want to continue to pursue a career in my major. Since I was small I’ve always enjoyed helping people in any way possible and making sure that they’re okay. Going into my major just makes me happy to know that the end plan of it all is going to be to be able to help people especially kids. I really see a future where I will be helping kids and adults with the medical help that they need. Especially in low-income families where I want to really be helping since I come from a low-income family and I know the struggles of getting good medical help for you and family.
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,531,"I want to go into my major, so I can get out of here. I need to get into my major sometime soon. I hope to get into my major by spring 2021. I need to follow through with this plan because I have a lot of pressure from my parents to graduate next year. Although I know I'm not, I'm not too sure how to break it down to them. The pressure has been on my chest and I can't wait to tell them and get that sense of relief. My biggest fear is how they will react. That is what ultimately scares me. I know it's normal not to graduate on time. I just don't know how to get through them. My mom especially has such high standards for me. With all that set aside I really want to get into my major because it's one step closer to my goal, to finishing college, to becoming a dentist. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,333,"I wanted to get into my major because I wanted to be that point person that I never had. In my family I am the first to go to a university and further my education I decided to go into the STEM field because I wanted to make a difference and because we lack people of color in important fields and our people aren't being treated equally as others are. I remember when I was little, my grandparents wouldn't want to go to the doctor because they didn't understand the doctor and if they would they couldnt communicate their needs to the doctor. They would feel like going to the doctor was useless even though they really needed it, they would wait months until they could go to Guatemala and see a doctor there instead. A lot of people aren't getting the care they need from their doctors even now because of all these barriers. I want to go into the STEM field so in the future I can go to medical school and become a doctor. I want to help people in my community and be that point person and that help my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles didn't have. When I used to work for a scholarship here in Richmond, parents faces would light up when they saw that I could speak Spanish. The most rewarding feeling is how thankful they are for helping them and representing them in these environments where we lack representation. They aren't your family but they tell you they're proud of you and that's the most rewarding feeling, giving back."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,542,"I want to get into the nursing program at sf state. I know it's a long shot but at least i tried. I want a maor that I can make use of. I don't want to major in something I might never make use of career wise. I want to do something in my life that makes use of my efforts. I know the stress of being a nurse. I volunteered last summer in a hospital and it was stressful even for me. There was so much waiting around for doctors orders and still taking care of the important stuff. The people who spent the most time with patients are the nurses. They are the one who gets to know them, they take care of patients till they are okay and ready to go home. Even with all that, they are communicating to the day and afternoon staff and night shifts about their patients' charts and with doctors and scheduling appointments that a patient might request and need. I volunteered at ACU (pre-operation)/ PACU(after operation) and general ward. Honestly the best feeling out of volunteering was being the first face they see when they come in for surgery (help they need), and the last face they see when I wheelchair them to the exit to head home (when they get the help they need and are ready to go home). P.s : patients are usually wheelchaired down to the exit to prevent any injury."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,545,I'm a pre-biology major right now. Hopefully by next semester I will be able to declare my major in Biology. I want to pick Biology Cellular and Molecular. But biology wasn't the first major I pick originally at first I was a computer science major and in my second year I decided it wasn't for me so I switched to Biology. The main reason why I wanted to go into my major because it was my favourite subject in high school and I was pretty good at it. I was decent enough at it where I would teach other students about it if they were having more trouble and my biology teachers like that. I just find my major interesting and there is so many cool things to learn about and as a plus the major is pretty flexable because you can do so many careers through it hopefully someday I will know what I want to do.
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,554,"I want to go into my major because it will make things easier when I am in medical school and learning the topics that involve biology. I am also apart of my major to grow my knowledge and learn skills that will help me in life. With a college degree in biology I will be able to apply to medical school in a few years and along the way create friendships with people from all walks of life and from all around the world.	 While in different classes at San Francisco State and in the research I will be doing in the summer. Biology has also prepared me for my summer research that has a lot to do with cells and the different parts in them and how they reproduce and things like that. Being in college allows me to have more opportunities in life. I will have more options being college educated. I can do a lot with a degree in biology, I have so many options, I can be a marine biologist,environmental specialist, conservation scientist,high school teacher, and many more. But my main goal is to go to medical school. Those are just backup plans."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,551,"I want to go into my major because I have a passion for the Nutrition field. When I first began college, I thought that I was supposed to choose my major based on how prestigious that major would seem. However, after getting my Associates Degree for first major that I was pursuing, I began a job in that field and I absolutely hated it. It was then that I knew I had to go back to school to earn my Bachelors Degree in a field that I was passionate about. Learning about Nutrition makes me happy. I am never bored in my classes and I am always excited to learn the material. After I stopped caring about everything else that was not important (such as how prestigious I thought that major would seem), I began to realize and appreciate how important my own major is. So I am going into my major because I have a passion for learning about that material and I also want to apply that knowledge to help those in need. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,547,"I want to be a biology major because it is what interests me the most. In high school, I was in honors freshman biology and my senior year I took AP biology and actually passed the test. I like learning about the different organisms that are on the earth and how they function. Even though I am not sure what I want to do with my major career wise, I feel like anything involving this subject will make me happy. I am really grateful that I switched my major to biology. I really liked my biology classes so far. The only classes that I do not like are calculus. Sometimes chemistry can be hard but once you understand the material, it is super rewarding. I know that school is only going to get a lot more stressful, which I am not looking forward too. Overall, I wanted to major in Biology because I find it interesting. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,552,"I want to become a mechanical engineer because ever since I was little I would play with legos all day building all sorts of things from rocket ships to dragons, my imagination was endless. I never even thought about becoming an engineer because at that time what really caught my eye were firefighters and policemen. Seeing them save peoples lives while getting to drive a police car or firetruck was amazing. It was not until high school when I had to really think about what I wanted to do with my future. I really thought about it and came to a resolution of being an engineer. I want to work at NASA and potentially become an astronaut. This is my greatest drive for wanting to become an engineer. I want to build the next great spaceship that can venture far greater distances and maybe be a member part of the flight."
