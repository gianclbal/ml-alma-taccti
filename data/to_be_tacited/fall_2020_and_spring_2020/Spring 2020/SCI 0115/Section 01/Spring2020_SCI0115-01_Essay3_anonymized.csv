2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,554,My family values have greatly pushed me to succeed in college and pursue a degree. In my immediate family my mother and sister have went to college but do not complete it. I am the first of my siblings to go a four year university and I am half way done since I am in my second year and expect to graduate in four years. My aunt is the only one in my immediate family to finish college and receive a degree from a four year university. She went to Loyola Marymount University and became a teacher after completing her education. Since she has been through college she has been a major help for me and made navigating college easier than it would have been on my own. My mother and sister have also been very helpful with giving me advice for when times get challenging. Also in my community all of my neighbors are very proud of me and always congratulate me when I go back home for break and tell me how proud they are of me and wish me the best. Because I live in a lower middle class area none of them have been to college so when I left everyone was very proud.
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,551,"Yes, the values of my family have helped me navigate through college. My family works very hard, no matter their situation in life. My mom at one point worked 3 jobs to support us. She was tired and still continued to do that day after day. She could have easily asked me to get a job so that I could help with the bills, but she had me focus on school. So now that I am here, yes, I work hard for myself, but I also work hard for her. Everything that she did for me will not go to waste. Hopefully, one day I can return the favor to her as well. I also look at my sister. She has a fantastic career. She loves it. However, she didn't wake up one day and magically have that job. She had to spend nights studying to exams and doing a great deal of homework before she reached her goal. I look at the two of them for inspiration. They have great values and a strong work ethic which has inspired me to work hard in college. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,546,"Right now, I'm feeling pretty anxious about the changes going on in different aspects of my life, especially with school with the pandemic putting many stops on things. I grew very accustomed to the routine I had involving school and was able to work efficiently and at a pace I could handle. Now with everything being put online, having to create a whole different routine has been really difficult. I also made sure to do most of my work at the school library during my breaks after class because I hated working at home. Now having all classes and school work being done at home has frustrated me. There are many worse things going on in the world surrounding the pandemic and feels kind of foolish and selfish to just think about how my education is affected. So I am reminding myself to be grateful and trying to push myself past this stump I'm in. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,333,"I feel like my community and family have really helped my navigate through college because they have been a constant support through these past couple of years. I feel like my community helped me when I received a scholarship from my city and they kind of helped me navigate by applying to receive financial aid, and to apply to different colleges and universities. They also gave me a job opportunity that I am so very grateful for. I spent 3 years helping other people from my community apply to college and provide them with resources I wish I had when I started applying to college and attending college. We did a Lot of workshops that had to do with college and I feel like even though I was directing them I still learned something new from every one of them. It's very difficult being first generation college student because no one can really help you with important things you need to get done. My family has also been a very good support system and even though they can't help me with college things they help me with giving me their support and encouragement all the time. It's very rewarding to see that they're all very proud of me and kind of show it off with other people as well. They have also helped me giving me good values that I have taken with me through out my life and use all the time."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,542,"You asked for a stream of consciousness and here it is. My personal values are honestly pretty simple. I want to be a happy person overall. As dark as it is, i want to look back when my time comes and not have any regrets in life. No major regrets that is. I dont want to look back in my lifetime and think i should have done this or i should have tried this. My families values are not as simple as mine, it was to mostly graduate school, find a high paying job so i wouldnt have to struggle for money and have a family. No joke, my dad was “jokingly” asking me when he was getting a grandchild from me. Answer is... Not until i am financially and emotionally ready for that responsibility. My mom was and still is the one who is pushing me and stil convincing me that being a nurse is the best option in life. Its a high paying job and its not hard to find work when you are a nurse. She doesnt know or honestly care about the work and school and pressure there is in becoming one. I volenteered in a hospital last summer and it was so overwhelming even for me as a volunteer. Nurses running around everywhere and pulled in all directions at all moments. They get dismissed as a professional because they arent doctors, they are overworker and understaffed, they deserve just simple recognition. They are the ones that have the most contact with patients, they are the ones caring for the patients. All “small” tasks are done by them. I simply do not understand why some people are rude to them and dismissive towards them. Same goes for cashiers and janitors. They dont get paid to take crap and attitude from customers. They get paid to do their job which are working the cash register and cleaning. They do enough, theres no need to make more work for them. I hat it when people say “the janitor will clean it” they just did. Clean your own mess."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,547,"Growing up, I was always expected to go to college. Both my parents are college graduates and my high school pushed us to apply to colleges and universities. I have always looked up to my parents, so I have been consistently told that college was the only option for me. Through out high school I made sure to keep my grades up and take classes that were recommended to get into college. My high school did a good job of preparing me for college work due to AP classes and the teachers telling us how professors usually teach. So far I have actually enjoyed college and have met so many amazing people. I am so glad I have kept the friends that have helped me push through many finals and midterms. Even though college is very stressful and draining, I would not want to be anywhere else but learning about things I find interesting. I have my parents to thank for getting me through the most stressful times of college. I am also grateful for my roommates and amazing friends that I have made in college for help me push through the hard times. Overall, my community and family have helped me stay persistent so far throughout my college career. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,543,"Kimberly RamirezFamily is everything to me. If I were to pick the family member that means the most to me, it would be my mother. She has influenced me in so many ways throughout my life. Having me at a young age gave her the strength to make sure that I would grow up to do many of the things that she never got the chance to do, such as go to college, get degrees, have a successful career, and travel. My mother is very strong, confident, and independent, and she has raised me to be like that as well. In addition, my father is another person that I look up to because he taught me the value of hard work and getting as much of an education as possible. I have been through a lot of hard times and my family has always been there for love and support. Getting through college hasn’t been easy, but I know that even though they don’t have college experience themselves, my family and community will always be a strong support system available. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,544,"The values of my family helped me navigate through college by motivating me to always do good in school because they want the best for me. They also motivate by setting goals and maintaining to achieve small goals instead of one big goal. My parents and other adults in my family always told me that my education will always be there for me and to make it my priority in life. They motivate and help me so much by helping to pay for my education. My aunt helps pay for my transportation which is BART because I cannot afford to live on or near campus, so i am super thankful for her. Also my cousins helped me navigate though college because they help prepare me on what to expect going to college and they if i ever struggled on something I would always go to them for help or advice. The adults in my family or even anyone who finished college showed me that it will be worth it in the end."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,553,"Growing up, I never felt like I belonged to a specific community as I grew up moving around because of the marine corps. However, once I started high school I discovered JROTC and joined the program of 150ish cadets my freshman year. Following that year, I moved from Okinawa, Japan back to the US, this time to sunny Southern California. After researching many schools in the local area with a similar program that I could transfer to, I discovered a brand new program at Fallbrook High School. This program taught me not only how to carry marine corps values such as honor, courage and commitment, but also how to be a leader and how to be a good role model. This program is helping me navigate college because of the support I had from not only my instructors, but also my peers. This program taught me that despite being far away from the people who matter to you, they will always be with you. This has helped me stay motivated and feel less lonely while navigating a new environment without the nearby support of my family. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,316,"I feel very grateful for the community/environment I grew up in, because I feel like it instilled many values that I still hold to this day. Additionally, several of these values have helped navigate me through college. One of those values is hard work. My parents are immigrants, and so they have worked extremely hard throughout their lives in order to be successful. For me, I know that there are some classes that require work, and I have to put in the time and be disciplined in order to be successful. Another value is determination. As previously mentioned there are going to be subjects and topics that are going to be difficult to grasp in not only science but all my classes in university. Thus being determined to understand is super important, and I find myself doing so by going to office hours, asking questions and joining SCI classes. Lastly, I think it is important to value yourself, and know that a grade on one test does not define you, or your academic success. When things like that happen, it is important to recognize what went wrong, and what I learned, and future actions from preventing it from happening again."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,548,My family values have been to always work hard for what I want. I come from parents who work in the agriculture fields they always came home so worn out from being out in the hot sun all day and their bodies aching. My parents always remind us to keep working hard so that we don’t have to be doing hard labor. My parents always remind me and my brothers that we have the capability to do anything we set our mind on and that nothings ever impossible. My parents also tell us that there’s going to be many people out there that doubt us but to only prove those people wrong. Every time that I feel like I’m going to give up I just go to my family they always seem to have the best motivating advice to get me back on my feet. My Latino/a community is also very motivating. I’m involved in a lot of Latino/a groups and the people there only strive to get you to succeed. Their values is to help everyone succeed 
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,531,"College has always been an option. My parents and family made sure to get it through to me that nothing else is an option. Honestly I've never really questioned or had doubts about going to college. Most of my friends in high school also had an effect on me because they're stands were high too, so college was a must for them. They were the ones that kept me on track with when applications were due for CSU's and UC's, and when the people were going to come to our campus to help families complete the FAFSA application. One of the biggest reasons I'm here is because I am an older sister of four girls. Being that I am the oldest I feel obligated to be successful, to be a role model to all my little sisters. In general I am first generation, so I feel a lot is expected from me. Sometimes the pressure is real. As for my community I come from a small town. Everyone knows everyone. I feel like my community is very caring towards me as I higher my education. I hope to become a dentist one day. I believe the Dentist in the area has reached out to my mom to take me under their wing. For example like with internships, help with advice on how to study and pass the DAT. I'm very grateful for those around me that continue to support me and remind me why I'm here.. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,549,"As a latina woman pursuing a career in the STEM field, I would say it has not been easy for me. Other than facing constant stereotypes and not seeing enough people that look like me as role models for scientific contribution, having to face other obstacles such as finances and having to split my time to work or take care of other things have been exhausting for me. My mom has taught me to work hard for what I want and she told me that I will have to work a bit harder because of my background and because of my Dreamer status. But despite all the obstacles I have face and will continue to face, the thing that has really kept me going is my community in San Francisco, being a sanctuary city as well as the community in SFSU because of the financial aid. The people that are around me as well who push me to study instead of going out and procrastinating. The little things like that make a huge difference in my academic achievement."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,550,"I think my community values of struggling in America because of my skin color and the main goal being survival has heavily pushed my school thinking. So far with my college experience, obviously I want to do well in classes, and in the classes I'm adept at, I do well. But for the more difficult classes it comes down to survival. How can I best do well in this class while also tackling my other difficult classes. I try to find ways/shortcuts on getting better handling the information. Quizlets, memorization, understanding the types of tests the teachers give out and what their goal is for what they want us to learn and how. Should I focus on this class less and just pass to do well in another? Etc. I find the optimal way of success and shoot for that. As African Americans as well as other colored Americans have to fight 2 times as hard for the same others have, I have to fight to survive in college, and so far that has been working."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,338,"I am a second generation American and college student; however, my parents had to sacrifice a lot to be able to give me the opportunity to be in college. Both my parents are first generation Americans and college students and as many first generation individuals, they combated immense poverty, discrimination and new obstacles that their families could not support them with. However, despite their obstacles both my parents chose to pursue higher levels of education. My father is an electrical engineer and my mother is a family practice physician. Due to their career aspirations, I was not raised by my parents and was raised predominantly by my great aunt. My aunt is an immigrant from El Salvador and I truly learned the values of hard work, determination and resilience from her. She instilled that I could do anything I put my mind to as long as I worked hard and had passion to help others. All things considered, my family's sacrifice, determination, resilience and passion to succeed; I believe has pushed me to this point in my life. I am truly cut from their fabric and I am blessed to be able to call on them and their experience to navigate college. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,545,My community and family don’t really help me too much navigate through college too much. But what I guess what helps me get through the hard times in college is thinking how much money my parents are wasting for me to be able to be here. Failing means wasted money. I would have to take the class over again. And just giving up college for the whole year would be expensive for my parents and they would get really mad at me. So just the thought of failing classes isn’t an option (at least willingly and giving up). I have to try my hardest to pass. That’s what my parents always tell me when I talk about my classes and I’m worried about failing them. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,552,"My family and community has helped me a lot to navigate through college. I am part of a program called College Track. You start this program during your freshman year of high school and continues on until you graduate college. They offer a wide variety of help as you transition from High school to college such as financial aid, wellness workshops and etc. They help ensure a smooth transition as long as you put in the required work, My family has also helped me a lot. They would help me with applications and financial obstacles along the way so that I can be stress free of financial stability. This allows me to just focus on my academics and work towards my career aspirations. My family is always mindful when it comes to my studying because it can get loud at times with two younger brothers so when I am studying they try to be quiet and give me space. That allows my mind to concentrate and not get distracted by things that can throw me off and make me lose my train of thought."
