2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,545,"I'm having trouble trying to pick one concept that benefits society or is applicable to people's life. So instead I will choose the whole concept of Chemistry while it may be a broad concept without chemistry humanity would never be able to advance and will forever be in the stone age. It wasn't until people long ago started experimenting with different substances to make new ones. We wouldn't have cellphones, video games, computers anything technological without chemistry. We would have no idea what exactly light is and how it works, but now we have ways of categories like radios waves, microwaves, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays and Gamma rays. Not only is chemistry really interesting especially my favourite concept of light I still memorize the speed of light 299458792. Scientists today use light to find exoplanets far far away in space since every element has its own light spectrum when light is shown through it that is how scientists know what a plant's atmosphere is made of and if it has the right elements they can possibly support life. And thats not the only thing they can do they can also use it to see how far away the exoplanet is from their star which is very important since if they are too close it will be too hot and if its too far away it will be too cold to support life. It needs to be just right to be warm enough to support life. It's really cool to think about this at least to me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,548,"How do IMFs versus temperature in different phases of matter work?In the solid phase IMF’s dominantes interactions, temperature has very little effect on interactions. Liquid IMF’s still dominate interactions, but temperature has a larger effect on interactions. While during the gas state IMF’s do not affect interactions while temperature dominates all interactions.This information is relevant and applicable to people's lives because it explains why some certain things happen. For example if you are to put a coke in the freezer the pressure of that coke will increase to the point of possibly exploding in your freezer because of the pressure change. This will probably startle you and will have you wondering why it happened in the first place so these phase changes are important. It is also important and relevant because in science we need to know what liquids,chemicals..etc we can alter the temperature too without causing any explosions or chemical reactions that are hazardous.So that is why we learn the basics in elementary and middle school but once you get on the highschool and college levels the explanation is much more detailed to know the outcomes of why and how things happen.Without knowing these effects of the phases a lot of people would end up hurt from the reactions of these phase changes in products, or chemicals that can be very life costing."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,544,"A concept that I learned in class that can be applied to our daily lives would be predicting precipitation with different elements and the states of matter: phases. I am not sure if this is the right type of example for this but a person can apple the different phases: gas, solid, and ice by mixing ice and coffee which could be solid and liquid, or a person can determine what state of matter for phases it is. Predicting precipitation could be telling if both solutions are soluble or not. When mixing two different cation and anion you can determine if there would be an reaction or not. I think I did something like this in lab the week before spring break where we added drops of a certain elements together and it changed the color of the liquid. I honestly do not know if i put these topics into the right concept of a person's everyday lives"
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,551,"Some relative content that has been discussed in class has been the quarantine. It has been hard to adjust to all the changes. In these past short weeks I have had to move out of student housing and move back to Modesto, Ca. I am not too happy to be back in my home town. There are a lot of distractions here which is why I left this city. However, on a brighter note, it is nice to be with family.  I know that this quarantine affects many lives. People are not able to go to work, and so many students have to find other locations to study and complete assignments, which may be very inconvenient for them. Other material that has been discussed in class, besides the quarantine, has been what is ionization energy? Ionization energy is energy that is required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion. An example of this is, if we were to put some elements in order from smallest amount to largest amount of ionization energy of F, Li, N, Rb, then  Rb, Li, N, F would be the correct order. Society could benefit from knowing more about ionization energy because it can be related to static energy. People may want to know why they are being shocked when they touch a door knob. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,554,The coronavirus has changed a lot of things in my life. I have been forced to stay inside and take my college classes online. It’s made simply going to Target and getting food harder because now there are long lines that are outside the store. And it has even cost me a job. Before the major outbreak I was working towards a job at Trader Joes and I had it secured until all of the restrictions and I felt it wasn’t worth the risk of getting the virus. When I could just ultimately work when all of this is over with. It’s not like I was forced to have a job but it would have been nice to gain some extra real world experience and make money.I feel really bad about the people who did lose their jobs because of the outbreak. Luckily no one in my family was affected in that way but I did have a few classmates that lost their jobs which sucks because they supported themselves by working.Another thing that sucks about the outbreak is the hold on all professional sports like basketball. That I loved to watch and couldn’t wait for the playoffs that would have happened like a week ago and see who was going to win this year's NBA championship. It also surprised me to see how many nba players contracted the coronavirus and how fast they were cured of it.
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,553,"What is stoichiometry?In chemistry, stoichiometry refers to the quantitative relationship between two compounds in a chemical equation. to determine an unknown amount of a substance during a reaction. By using stoichiometry, we are able to form molar ratios between the compounds in a reaction. We can use this topic in cooking as well as in a chemistry lab. For example in baking when the recipe calls for two cups of flour and well as three eggs. Here we can see we have a 2:3 ratio. We can then use these ratios in order to reduce or expand the recipe. If I were to have four cups of flour, I could then use stoichiometry to determine that I would need six eggs. Applying these topics outside of the chemistry lab may make the material easier to understand as we are using variables that are more familiar to us."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,552,"what are the main states of matter, why do they play such a big role in chemistry and what are their differences? The main states of matter are solid, liquid and gas. The are important when it comes to chemistry because they help identify what state of matter a chemical compound or atom are. Mainly you can differentiate them because solids have particles super close to one another and have very little movement; while, liquids have a disordered structure of particles and a little bit more movement, and finally gas, they tend to have particles more spread out and have more movement around them. You can easily use a phase diagram to help distinguish how pressure and temperature affects the phase of matter like how went solids become liquid its called melting or vice versa which then becomes freezing. There is a point where all three intersect called the triple point and usually H2O is in place of that point because it can hold all three of those phases which makes it at equilibrium. In general physical processes do not change the chemical component of substances only the physical state. For example when dissolving instant coffee in water, the substance still has water in it"
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,333,"I feel like in Sci we talked about the possibility of being in quarantine a couple of weeks ago. This was a very important topic to talk about as well because we were so uncertain of what was going to happen, we didn't think things were going to get this out of hand. I remember talking to a few of my professors who hadn't thought about a plan for the class just in case something like this did happen. I think it was very important and wise of the instructors to talk to us about the possibility, they even helped us install zoom which I didn't know how to use. Them doing that has helped me in my other courses because they're all via zoom. I know how to navigate through it because of them, since we had some time to download it into our devices during class. Another thing that I think was helpful to cover during class even though at the moment it may have seemed like we were ahead but little did we know it would help us right now, the VSPER theory and the table and the molecular orbital theory, knowing those things before and going over them in class helped me a lot. I feel like learning it online would've been much more difficult than in class. I can't think how this would be relevant to regular people who aren't taking chemistry but It was very very helpful for me this semester. I know things are kind of weird right now but the sci instructors have made it so that we can easily navigate through chemistry and still keep the information fresh in our minds, which is very important. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,550,"So far, chemistry has been one of my more interesting classes. I really like how chemistry covers more than just elements and stereotypical mixing of beakers. What has been particularly interesting to me is the concept of measuring the speed of light. It closely reminds me of science fiction movies and it gives us a speed to shoot for eventually with our space transportation, maybe one day with intensive studying of chemistry for the past couple centuries will lead us to amazing space travel feats. The study of the speed of light and emission of other lights is extremely interesting to me. Comparing the intensity of different waves in our known universe is also extremely interesting to me. I feel knowing what waves are harmful and what ones are less harmful opens up the possibilities to better our lives with the power of technology. For instance (something that has been in the news a lot recently due to a weird conspiracy) 5GLTE is a great scientific advancement, a lot of people are saying its harmful but without hyperbole, it is less harmful than standing outside in the sun. With virtually no downsides aside from needing more high-speed 5G data towers (which don't cause cancer, I am not sure why people are saying this, there's no evidence of that)"
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,546,"Explain ""like dissolves like.""The first concept that comes to mind is the concept of ""like dissolves like,"" the concept that we learned during Lab 6: Solutions and Attractive Forces. I guess in a way this can be related to real life in how we interact with people and how we form our relationships. The lab shows us how polar molecules dissolve with polar molecules, nonpolar molecules dissolve with nonpolar molecules. Polar methanol dissolves in polar water. Nonpolar iodine dissolves in nonpolar hexane. It is the same way how we tend to become friends who are similar to us. We are attracted to those we share personality traits with or have other things in common with. In the same way, sometimes we are hesitant to form relationships with people who are the complete opposite of us. We will feel like there is no way for us to bond or get along. ""Like dissolves like"" can be seen as ""similar attracts."""
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,547,"At first I thought balancing equations was going to be hard for me. However I had a hard time learning how to find molarity. I don't know why it took me so long to learn. It was really confusing because I was not sure how to set up the equations to solve the problems. I had a hard time putting the ratios together. For example, the when the question wants the answer in grams, I get a little lost. I know that you have to put them in the right ratios so they can cancel out correctly, but it does get a little confusing. When I check my work I am always like one off. Or I switch numbers that should have been on the other ratios. I finally am getting the hang of how to formulate the ratios to find the answer. In the lectures, Choi explains that finding molarity and grams of concentrations are used daily by scientists. The more I practice the more and more I am understanding how to form the equations. I thought  I was going to have a hard time with balancing equations. So far, the equations we needed to balance are pretty easy. I might be speaking too soon, but hopefully the hard part stays being finding the molarity and grams of solutions. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,338,"I am still having some confusion with how to acquire formal charge and with that said, I would really appreciate touching on how to best get the formal charge. By looking at the lewis structure of a specific atom I can note what the charge will be but I have still found getting the formal charge a bit confusing. Additionally, understanding how to determine specific intermolecular forces has also been a challenge. For example, how can one determine what molecule is dipole-dipole or dispersion? My other area of inquiry is determining hybridization. Is there a method that best helps with finding hybridization? Lastly, how do I go about filling bond orders. We have had similar examples in the past but the set up of these newer diagrams and knowing when to fill is still a bit unclear. A further explanation of diamagnetic and paramagnetic would also help to facilitate this last concept that I am having confusion about. I believe these following topics may help serve the class because I know from speaking to other classmates that these are topics that are still troubling to grasp collectively. This course is overall will benefit society as many of us are wanting to work in the medical field and although this is an introductory course, we are learning the building blocks to understand other course in the future (ie. biochemistry) which will give us the pathway to understanding the workings of the human body."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,542,"The concept I want to talk about would be solubility or the basic concept of solubility. I want to be a nursing major but I have taken many biology classes that are pre-reqs and also some for my interest. When I think of solubility I think of digestion. In chemistry solubility refers to reactions and its limiting reagents almost like the body’s reaction of food and its conversion to energy. I noticed that I tend to like sour and spicy foods that tend to be more acidic. I like the concepts we went through in class about chemical reactions and finding its products. It makes me more aware of the chemical things people use on the daily like cleaning supplies. Gives me knowledge about the potential gases that might form when mixing any chemicals even when diluted with water. I'm honestly not sure if its relevant to anything but its my way of connecting the concepts learned in class to my personal everyday life. I also noticed the use of chemistry in making foods and baking. Everyone knows when you bake a cake, there is a basic foundation and ratio that's easily changed. There needs to be a certain amount of things for a reaction (rising) to happen. The steps of baking also matter just like a chemistry experiment."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,316,"Reflection Journal Essay #4Right now life feels pretty bizarre to say the least. On Tuesday March 24th, all six counties of the Bay Area went on lockdown, meaning that all non essential business (everything except, gas stations, grocery stores and pharmacies had to close their doors.) Additionally, all gatherings of people were banned. This was the first major action taken in the United States, and then many other cities followed suit like New York City and Los Angeles. On Monday March 16th Lynn Mahoney, president of San Francisco State University announced remote classes for all classes until April 7th (which got extended until the end of the semester as of right now.) It definitely feels pretty surreal, and many people are getting used to their new normal whether that be working from home or creating their new daily routine while practicing social distancing. It is really upsetting seeing many people disregard social distancing and continue going out in large groups. I saw a news report about college spring breakers in Florida who did not care whatsoever about the virus and the consequences of continuing to party. I found it so selfish and disrespectful because although they may have a good chance of recovering, they can unknowingly pass it on to someone who has health issues and could possibly die. I personally feel a bit overwhelmed because my daily routine got completely disrupted and I am a little stressed out about classes. Many of my classes have labs and the material is harder to learn in an online platform like chemistry. However, I know my professors are trying their best to move non-online classes into a online friendly format which is very difficult to do. My biology labs have been canceled through April 5th, so I am interested in seeing how they are going to convert that. Overall, I think this is a good time to take time to do things we normally don’t have time to do, like read a book or pick up a new hobby while taking care of our mental and physical health."
