Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,542,"Why am i here? Why am I here? I am here to be better prepared for classes and/ or chemistry. I am here to be more skilled and prepared for chemistry. I want to pass chemistry and I thought the class will help me be more prepared for the Exams and Quizzes that will be given. I also want to be more prepared for the labs for the semester and know whats going on and what i'm doing during the labs and be more prepared for it. I want more than just a passing grade, I want to be present physically and mentally when in class and lectures and actually understand what is being lectured. I am also curious about other Sci classes offered for the past semesters and if there are classes that are offered for non science classes. I want to get a high grade and boost my gpa and chemistry will look good on my transcript for the future. I am a pre nursing major and chem 115 isn't exactly for pre nursing majors but i still took the class because it's a challenge and i thought it would help the concepts of dilutions and the equations and everything."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,543,"Kimberly Ramirez 2/10/20 People have always said that when it comes to goals and dreams, it's about the journey, not the destination. I believe that to be true. It isn't enough to set a goal in mind. You have to think about how to get to that goal. I think that I am here because of a number of bumps that I have overcome. Being diagnosed with a chronic condition is one of them. I have been subjected to so many treatments, medications, doctor appointments, and hospitalizations, I have lost count on the exact number. But I didn’t let that stop me from catching up in school and celebrating special occasions with my family. Once my health started improving, I dedicated my focus to advancing my school and future career aspects. Since no one in my family ever lived the college experience, I had to rely on teachers and mentors for help. It wasn’t easy, since I have always had a hard time speaking up. But somehow, I managed and before long, I found myself at San Francisco State University, as a first-generation student. I hope to continue my long but heartfelt journey so that I can have a career and a life that I am proud of."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,544,I am here because I wanted to take this class since I am not the best at chemistry and wanted all the help that I can get. I work better in groups than myself because i feel like different opinions and ways can help me understand how to solve the problem. I wanted to take this class because I hope to get a better understanding on majority of the topics being taught in lecture. Another reason why I am here is to aim for the best grade I deserve while still understanding the topic instead of copying off someone else or online. I hope this class will help me understand more what I am doing in seminars and labs or even in the future. I am at school to figure out what my passion is in life by taking different courses and seeing if I enjoy taking those specific classes. I entered college without knowing what I want to pursue in life and i hope i figure it out soon by taking different general education classes.
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,545,The main reason why i am here is because i needed 12 units so i can be considered a full time student. Because before i had 10 units because i was only enrolled in biol 240 and Chem 115 which are both 5 unit classes. And my advisor recommended i shouldn't take any more regular classes because chem 115 and biol 240 are hard classes already and im taking them together. And i wanted to be considered a full time student so she recommended i take the support class for chem 115 and biol 240 so i can have 12 units. I suppose the second reason why im here is just for the extra support im case if i need it since there are some hard classes so it wouldn't hurt to just take them. I've taken support classes in the past and it alwats helps. Also its a free A for my gpa as long as i show up to the class.
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,546,"For the longest time, I have struggled with this question and I feel as though I still am. The first thing that comes to mind when I hear this question is I am meant to help people. It is a very cheesy and overused answer, but it has always been one of my biggest desires to help people hence why my major is pre-nursing. My surroundings and people close to me have been my biggest influence on why I believe this is my purpose and why I am here. I have grown up around some of the most selfless people I know. My grandaunt was a nurse in the Philippines. With her earnings, she sheltered many street kids, providing them food, water, even teaching them in her free time. My grandpa, though with very little money, would always bring money on his way to work in the mornings so that he could buy bread and coffee to any homeless people he came across. Even when my grandparents only had a small apartment in Oakland, they would offer their homes to any relatives who needed somewhere to stay whether for work or running away from their home. When I think about the people I look up, the people I strive to be, I think of them. I want to be as selfless and generous as they were, to care for people the way did. I can only hope to be half the people they were. I am still not completely positive if that is really my purpose in life, or why I am here, but it is what I want to work towards every day of life. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,547,"I am taking not only one but two sci courses this semester. I am taking these courses because I want to succeed in all my science courses. Especially because math is not my strong suite. I want to be able to fully learn what is happening in my lecture and lab classes. I have taken another sci class last semester and it did help a lot and also the A really helps your GPA. Taking these sci courses really does help with understanding lecture. These sci classes are also good for meeting more people that are in STEM. I want to be able to make connections with people I could possibly work with in the future. It is also nice to be able to meet people who know the struggle of being a STEM major, it allows us to finally relate. Overall, sci slows me to fully comprehend what I’m learning in class and lets us meet more people in the STEM field. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,548,"I’m here to get more support for chem-115. I’ve taken previous SCI courses and they have helped me with understanding topics that are complex. This class will also help me review and better prepare myself for when we have exams. I’m also here to learn and better understand certain topics that are taught in class especially the math portions. I have a really hard time remembering the steps to doing certain problems and I have to look back on notes to be able to do them so, I hope with the extra support that I will be getting in the class will help me improve on remembering the steps and not have to refer back to my notes too much."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,549,I am here because I have a drive to be in the STEM field because I want to be a part of the group of women of color that is studying in a scientific field that predominately white and male. This is my first ever semester taking a chemistry class ever. I have no experience studying chemistry in high school. The only thing that helped me was ALEKS and it has helped me understand concepts. So far I am understanding concepts so I am up to date and I have gone to the SB room 101 where they do tutoring and I figured taking a SCI class will increase my chances of passing this class with an A or B. I am here because I want to become a dermatologist and knowing a little chemistry really helps me understand the chemistry of the elements around us and thus increases my knowledge of this type of science. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,316,"This past semester I changed my major from Business with a concentration in Accounting to Biology (with a concentration in Physiology.) During high school, I wanted to go to university and study biology as a premed. However, at the end of my senior year I started to doubt myself and what I wanted to do with my life, so I turned down three scholarship offers in Canada and decided to stay local (here at SFSU) as an undeclared student. During my sophomore year here at SFSU, I was just as confused as when I came in and decided to declare business because everyone around me said it would be a good idea because you can do a lot with it. It wasn’t until my first semester as a junior that I realized that I saw no future for myself in business. Therefore, I decided to switch back to my very original plan to study biology. Currently my goal is to become a PA, and work in surgery, specifically plastics or orthopedics. It has been a few years since I studied science, so I think it is important that I get all of the help, and resources that are provided to me through the school."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,550,"I feel I signed up for this class because it seems that chemistry is going to prove difficult for me. The lecture class also doesnt really suit my learning, I need more of a one on one environment for true absorption. I need to work it out on my own on paper or try to then have it be shown to me on how to correctly go about solving the problem. This peice is essential for me, making the mistakes now and seeing how to avoid them keeps me from doing this process on tests/quizes. Working my issues out here will be my main support aside from homework. But the homework on aleks also isnt very helpful for me because it feels like I'm trying to punch through a brick wall without knowing there are tools better suited for the job. And when Aleks tries to tell me about the tools, they dont fully explain on how to use them, I still end up lost. This class will help alot in the future towards my understanding."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,338,"I am currently enrolled in this SCI 115 section because of my current and future career aspirations. I graduated from San Francisco State with a Bachelor's of Art in Psychology and I am currently in my Master’s program concentrating in Cell and Molecular Biology. With this in mind, I need a number of prerequisites and supplemental courses for my next career goal in obtaining an MD/PhD. I want to get a dual degree because I am constantly inspired to add to the breadth of knowledge in science and also being able to use what is discovered to directly improve patient care. Specifically, I want to ensure my research efforts are directed to improve health and access outcomes for marginalized groups. Most importantly, as part of an underrepresented community I want my patients to feel comfortable by having a provider that gives care that is culturally and linguistically sensitive. Since I did not obtain my undergraduate degree in a STEM I need to take all my prerequisites for medical school in my Master’s program. This includes Chemistry 115. I am taking this supplementary portion to solidify my knowledge I learn in class and to foster my overall understanding. All things considered, these are all the reasons I am here.       "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,551,"Sorry, the reason for the late assignment is because I added the class, and originally wrote the answer on paper, since I didn't have access to ilearn. I am here because I want to do better in Chem 115. I took chem 100 and I got a C. I know that I could have done better if I would have had the extra help. However, I do know that professors can become overwhelmed with the amount of classes, students, and grading that they have. So I think that this class will provide me with the extra help that I need for me to earn an A in Chem 115. I also like the fact that I can ask the SCI instructors questions about Chem 115 material, questions regarding calculations, Alex homework, and upcoming exam material. I really regret not taking advantage of the SCI class last semester for CHEM 100, however, this is a new semester, and I am ready to learn. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,333,"I'm here because I know we all have something to learn. I noticed that we are all different people and we can offer different type of knowledge to each other. I think being here in San Francisco State offers me an opportunity to learn different things to open doors for me in the future. I am also here to advance my education and make my family proud. I'll be the first in my family to graduate from college and to attend college in general but I want to make them proud. After this I will pursue medical school. I have this big desire to help people in my community which is here in San Francisco because I grew up here but also in Richmond which is where I live. There is a big need for people of color in the medical field and I want to start to make a difference. You can see the way peoples face lights up when they see someone who looks like them and speaks their language. They start to open up and talk about their issues and health problems. I want to be that person for them, that doctor I wished I had. I'm here to help people around me in whatever I can because that's what I feel like we're all meant to do"
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,1,552,I am here because I would like additional help in my chem 115 course. I did not have that great of a high school chemistry teacher so my knowledge in chem is very minimal. Since the start of the semester I have been struggling to keep up with the course work because I do not really understand the concepts so when I get one or a couple right then the last one wrong it makes me restart. I want the additional help so that I can better grasp the concepts being taught in lecture. Chem is a difficult subject for me because there are numerous things that you have to remember. I think this class will benefit me and help guide me towards a good grade because its more one on one rather than being in a crowded room with over 100 students. I have a heavy course load this semester so taking this course will help me in a way lessen the amount of studying I need to do.
