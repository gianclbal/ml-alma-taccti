Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,555,"I am here, as I’ve taken CHEM 100 Preparation for Chemistry considering that I’m not that familiar with chemistry. I’m taking CHEM 115 General Chemistry I: Essential Concepts of Chemistry to get a grade of C or better because it’s a prerequisite for CHEM 130 General Organic Chemistry. I’ve enrolled in SCI 115 Science Concepts: Chemistry I because I thought it was necessary to acquire assistance in studying and learning the material for upcoming quizzes, tests, and exams. Relearning or learning the materials before it’s taught in class is beneficial to remembering and understanding it more. Practicing worksheets and mock exams then going over them is a good way of studying for the actual exam. This course is preferable than attending tutoring because as students, you already took the course and know how to reteach the materials more simply. There’s no need to explain to the tutor what I'm currently learning or what I need to study for the exams. All these courses are my lower-division requirements for my pre-biology major."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,556,The reason why I am Here is because I’ve heard chemistry is hard and it intimidates me. Going back to high school brings back really bad memories. I’ve Had good times and bad times with science over Audrey my school years back in middle school I had to my opinion one of the best physics teachers and he started a sparking me that started liking science but after that the other teachers I had just made me dislike science overall and not show up to class. Just to name chemistry intimidates me because of past situations I’ve had with past teachers but that’s the reason why I chose to take Sci 115 so I can overcome the intimidation and to show myself that I can do it. I don’t regret joining sci 115 because it has helped me a lot and it has helped me learn new learning techniques that I wouldn’t learn on my own and has helped me to learn new ways to study and to learn and how to do chemistry over all.   
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,557,"“Why am I here?”So why am I here in the class SCI-0115? I am simply there to have more guidance and practice on the material taught to me in my chemistry class. I believe that this class will help me out since I lack on actually practicing with the lesson material and just study everything a day or two before the big test, quiz, or exam. And notice that the teachers of this class are students just like me and that made me feel relieved and more comfortable. This is my first time taking a tutoring class and I knew I made the right choice deciding to take this science class I will need the help with chemistry either I took this or not. I knew that I was pretty bad with science as a subject since I was little. Whether it would be biology or chemistry, I knew that I would need extra support when it comes to science. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,558,"I am taking the SCI 115 class because I want to go beyond memorizing terms and concepts only to forget them within a month. In the past I have thought that chemistry was not my strong subject but I really want to change that. Being able to have time set aside to really absorb the material that we learn in both lecture and labs really helps. I can ask questions, relieve confusions, correct mistakes, learn tips and tricks, and develop good habits that will help me thrive in chemistry. It also gives me the opportunity to connect with others who are struggling with the same concepts that give me trouble. We don’t really have the time or opportunity to talk through questions and meet people in lecture. It always helps students to know we aren’t alone in our confusions. Although I like smaller classes I genuinely hope that our class gets more people so it can continue. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,559,"I am here because I want to be successful in my chem115 class. I don’t understand most things right now but I know I can with the help up sci115 and tutoring. I’m always scared to ask questions in lecture because of how many people are in there. In sci115 I believe that I will ask my peers and my instructors questions without hesitation. I’m here for motivation and what I mean is when I don’t know how to start or complete a problem, sometimes I’ll just end up giving up because I had no help. So the extra help will give me motivation and confidence while doing assignments at home. I am here because I believe this class with give me help and understanding to succeed and move on to other chemistry classes."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,560,Danica MicaelScience 115Journal #1					“ Why Am I Here? ”I signed up for Science 115 to get extra help for Chemistry 115 class. There was a group of students in my Chemistry 115 class inviting us to join a tutoring class that will give extra help for chemistry. My friends and I decided to join Science 115 to learn for deep about the lectures we learned in Chemistry 115 class. I am here to get one on one tutors for the lectures I do not understand well in Chemistry 115 class. I want to give myself more time to learn again about the lecture we get in class through Science 115. I need help in understanding how I can improve myself to be better for a specific problem I have during lectures in Chemistry 115. Joining this class will help me prepare for future lectures I will have in Chemistry 115. I hope by the end of this semester I will gain more ability to understand Chemistry because the extra help I will get in Science 115.
