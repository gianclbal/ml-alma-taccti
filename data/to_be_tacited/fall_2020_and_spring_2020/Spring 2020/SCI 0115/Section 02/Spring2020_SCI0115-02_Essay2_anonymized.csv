I try to write solutions for a day 's problems I get.Food can be a life challenge for some people. When I lack food I try to go for free groceries from our school. They give food every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. You will just need to bring a bag and your students ID. Stress can be a big challenge, I tend to solve this problem by talking it out with my friends, and getting help. Sometimes I do some relaxing to help my mind such as face mask, food, play piano, do diamond painting, or take a bath. Overall, when I receive a challenge in my life I try my best to overcome it by doing the things I love to do,  write down and find solutions for it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,556,"Something I do when life gets challenging is I put my AirPods in and I just listen to music and space out.  Another thing I do when life gets challenging is to try to play my guitar and just learn new tunes in a new note in the music and just express my feelings there. One last thing I do is I go talk to my dog which is my eight-year-old pitbull. He listens to me and doesn’t interrupt me and I love that about him. However, one thing I started doing to distract my mind was I started a garden, this quarantine I literally had nothing to do towards the beginning when It started so I created a garden and I got to grow many vegetables and flowers so that kept me busy from thinking about her and all the stuff going around. There’s this game called animal crossing and is popular on the Nintendo switch and yeah it says that I spent 75 hours on it so I would say I would use that to. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,557,"“What do I do when life gets challenging?”	When life gets challenging, I wish I could say that “When life gets difficult, I can just work my hardest and fight through until I succeed”, but in reality, I know that my mind will blank out and will be unsure of what to do even I just said the solution. I will tend to stress out and leave the challenges by doing other challenges that seem easier to deal with first just to not deal with the bigger problem in hand. It basically just sounds like I would procrastinate and think to myself that I’m being proactive by doing other forms of work. I guess it’s better than doing absolutely nothing, but I just wish that I can have the courage to ask for assistance for the difficult challenges just so I can get it over with. Knowing me, that would take me a while and when I do I would regret not asking for help earlier and had the problem solved already."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,558,"When life becomes challenging I get stuck in a loop. Ill write down everything that I know I have to do for a week but when I make a dent in the list, even more tasks seem to fill it. This week especially since classes are all online I have so much to keep track of ( such as homework, extra worksheets, readings, online quizzes and so much more). So much so that I didn’t even know I had this assignment. Over the past week I’ve also had to deal with a surplus of emails regarding school, work, and housing that I didn’t have the chance to look at them all (which is my responsibility and fault). When I get really stuck I will ask for help from teachers, friends and especially my parents. I probably ask too many questions sometimes because I am afraid of messing up and disappointing others. It probably isn’t the most healthy response but it is a natural one for me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,559,"In the past I would just give up and complain when life gets challenging but I’m sure I’m not the only one. Now I’m starting to learn that taking on a challenge can benefit me in the end. Like for instance I never thought I would switch my major to biochemistry because I would always say I probably just give up when the material got challenging.  But throughout my first 2 years of college I took pre-calc, calculus, now calc 2 and bio 240. Which were not easy but I took I had the help from tutors and taking side classes because I knew I could do it I just needed a little bit more practice and help. Honestly life will always have a challenge every once and a while but now I just take it as a learning lesson because I know that it’ll make me become a better/smarter person."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,555,"When life gets challenging, there is nothing that can recover me faster than music. Listening to my favorite music helps me feel refreshed and reduces depression. It calms and prevents me from overthinking about negative things. Sometimes life hits me hard at a certain point but I’m not overwhelmed by emotions when listening to calm, uplifting, and happy music. With this type of music, it motivates me to become more positive and erase my bad thoughts. It gives me the power to continue what I am doing. Nonetheless, music to me is something that I consider important in my life. Without it, I probably don’t know what I’ve done and if I was able to continue to be confident. However, music quickly became part of my mental treatment because it calms the nerves and helps my brain transmit positive signals to my body. That's why I have the courage to spend some time immersed in music when life gets challenging."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,561,"When life gets challenging, I try my hardest to see the good in every situation. Last year was the most challenging year of my life. I went through a breakup, and then my dad died a month later. It all happened during the first few weeks of the spring semester. Then, as I was trying to finish the semester, I would have to see my ex with his coworker on campus all the time. So, in order to keep my peace and power, I decided to journal and worship. Journaling allowed me to spill all of my thoughts instead of allowing it to cloud my mind. In terms of my spiritual journey, I made a worship playlist. It’s hard to see the light when all you see is darkness. Allowing yourself to pray and trust the process is vital for one to heal. Understanding that things happen for a reason will allow you to experience everything with a grain of salt. You just need to keep going."
