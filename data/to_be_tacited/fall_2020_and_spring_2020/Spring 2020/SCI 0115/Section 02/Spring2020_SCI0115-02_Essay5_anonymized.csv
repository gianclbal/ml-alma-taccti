I have always been an animal lover since I was little and It all started with dogs. I would usually read books about dogs and the types of breeds there are. There were so many kinds and I was so fascinated and all of the dogs in the book were so cute. So that gave me the love for all pet animals and many more. For many years, my thought of being a veterinarian would switch on and off because there were other things that I was interested in. Ultimately, I realized how much I want to help animals every time I see one and would want to see many more. Now I can’t really imagine my life without the thought of petting a cute animal every day and of course helping them get better. Right now, being in the biology major is pretty difficult for me, but I would remind myself every now and then why I chose to study in the biology major."

2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,555,"I am currently a pre-biology major, I want to go into general biology as my major because I want to become an Optometrist or to have an occupation within the medical field. To become an Optometrist, I must get a bachelor's degree in pre-med or anything relating to chemistry or biology. Then pass the Optometry Admission Test (OAT) to get accepted into a Doctor of Optometry (O.D.) program. Probably, it’s not possible to graduate within four years while majoring in general biology, then after that comes another four-year program.  It seems like a long process of intensive training, I'm not entirely positive if I want to follow this path. I'm currently deciding if I should continue being in pre-biology, I still not particularly certain what to do with my life. I’m indecisive about changing my major, so I’ll continue pre-biology until I’m certain of what to change it to. I'm currently exploring other options but deciding on what to become is challenging."

Then a physical therapist came to me when a guest speaker came into my sports medicine class, and he told us about how he was a little all over the world. He was able to get jobs even when he wasn’t looking because there are people who needed him, and he was always there to help. Since the new being a physical therapist would be a job for me. Because no matter what happens in the world, people always need somebody to help them get back on their feet figuratively and literally. "
