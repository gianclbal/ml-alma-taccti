2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,561,"In terms of benefiting society/ people’s lives, learning about how atoms can react with one another and create compounds is very important. Some reactants put together can be toxic, and in some cases, can cause fires/explosions. During quarantine, people are trying very hard to stay clean, but a lot of cleaning supplies are sold out. With that being said, a lot of people are mixing cleaners without realizing it may be toxic. Also, learning about Carbon Monoxide and Mercury is important. Back then, Mercury was found in a lot of thermometers. In third world countries, they still do because of different health regulations.  It's hard to think about Chemistry or math or English when there are thousands of people who are losing loved ones or are fighting for their lives. Families are being kicked out of their homes and are living paycheck to paycheck. All of it is just heartbreaking. My family are all nurses or doctors and the fact that I can't see them or keep my mom from having anxiety is one of the hardest things. But, I still need this degree, right?"
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,555,"A concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks, either in lecture or lab is stoichiometry. Thus my question is how do we use molarity to find solute moles and solution volume? To find the total moles of an element in the entire solution you must multiply or divide depending on the volume. Using the formula c=n/V, c=c*v, or V=n/c, where c stands for the concentration, n stands for the total moles of solutes, and v stands for the volume of solution. You can derive this formula by rearranging the definition of concentration. This information might be generally applicable to people’s lives/or how this information might be used to benefit society is because scientists and researchers use elements and volumes, and they might need to convert to different measurements. Some concrete information that was covered this semester, explaining why this specific information is relevant is how memorizing all the conversion to every measurement is critical because chemistry evolves around measurements. For example, a chemist adds 255.0mL of 0.343M of aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3)solution to a reaction flask. Calculate the millimoles of aluminum sulfate the chemist has added to the flask. This means there are 0.343 moles of aluminum sulfate dissolved in each liter of solution."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,556,"Reflection                    This past week has been the hardest for me because of Covid situation. It has put my family in shock because of what is happening around the world. It’s a situation many had to encounter a situation many weren’t prepared for. As a family my family and I have learned how to low key gets along with each other during this quarantine as well as thinking back in time and appreciating all the good days out on the sun. It has made me be thankful for my health and everyone around me. It has been tough with money situation; my mom has been without a job for more than a month now but we are fortunate enough to have family that are willing to help. I try to put myself in the shoes of others that do not have it like many of us. In a crisis like this many people are out starving with no roof over their heads. It makes me appreciate for everything I have. It has been hard to transition to online, and actually be able to learn. It feels like I am behind in many classes but as of yesterday I catching up."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,558,"I would like to know about how nutrition labels are made. This week we learned how to titration is used to determine amount of vitamin C and oranges and red bell peppers. We learned about how they have to be juiced and then using the titration an indicator dies along with I2. But there’s a lot more to these levels than we think. How do they determine how much is in other foods that can’t be used. I guess that something we will learn along the way. Is also making me think about how other products are made. More specifically Gatorade. I remember learning about hoe Gatorade was first created in my sports medicine class in high school. They started with what they wanted to have in the sports being and then added sugar until it tasted good. Now i know that there was more science in the process. They had to use dilutions and they had to make sure the reaction turned out positive. They would have to keep a careful record to continuously keep a balanced product and make sure everything stays aqueous. This relates to nutrition because when we look at the label the amount of sugar is massive while the ratio to salt and other important nutrients are much lower. Making this connection reminds me about how my grandmother, who had a masters in chem, worked tasting and refining ice cream for a while."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,557,"Select a concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks, either in lecture or lab, and formulate a question. Then look through your class notes, lab notes, and/or textbook and write an essay in response to your question, summarizing the relevant information. Discuss how this information might be generally applicable to people’s lives and/or how this information might be used to benefit society. Be sure to include some concrete information that was covered this semester, explaining why this specific information is relevant. Be sure to give examples.	I was learning about converting equations and it is a calculation that is almost always the limiting reactant. The conversion of species A in a reaction is equal to the number of moles of A reacted per mole of A fed. This information might be generally applicable to people’s lives by converting one amount to another amount. The only example I can think when it is used in baking by converting grams to cups. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,559,A concept that I had many questions on were Lewis structures. Even when it was taught in lecture and sci I was lost. My first question was how do I know how many valence electrons go with each and how do they make bonds? I would go back into my notes and nothing seemed to help. So I went to tutoring and they had talk me the basics the lewis dot structure and how many bonds each element takes. That helped me a lot and also knowing a balanced octet is 8.  There are also rules that can help but were confusing at first. Also this quarantine has been very stressful I find my professors to keep adding extra work. And some times I don’t even understand material because I get very distracted at home. so I try and take the time and go back to lessons and get a refresher which has been helping me.  Although when I want to catch up on other lesson/ class work. I find it harder to manage my time with being home and all. I hope this pandemic goes away so soon I wanted to go back to school and learn. Fingers-crossed.!
