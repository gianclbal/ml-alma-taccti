I have always thought of doing that for the majority of my life and will always aim to be good grades and do the best I can to be successful for my parents who couldn’t finish their education. Now that I am in college, I think about how education can really change someone’s life for the better or worse and I really am thankful that I was raised to the person I am now even if my parents can get pretty strict most of the time when it came to my grades throughout middle and high school. I am also the youngest of 3 sisters and I would look up to them thinking that I can also through with the studying and they are the ones who helped me navigate through college along with other support given to me."

2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,561,"In an Asian American household, the expectations of graduating with a doctorate or masters degree in the medical field are embedded in our minds. With so many cousins and siblings in that field, it is almost like there is a competition to finish within 4 years. When I started my college career, nursing was already a choice made for me. So, I had no idea how impacted the major was. I felt extremely defeated. I still want to finish, but I have to accept that it is going to take longer than expected. I think I navigated my way through college on my own. I took classes I wanted to take and I joined communities and organizations that made me feel wanted. I just wish there was not a big pressure to finish on time. I wanted the support from my family. The expectations are unreal. The values of finishing and betting the best was not healthy. I understand that me going to school is for myself."
2020,Spring,SCI 0115,SI,2,555,"The values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college because, at an early age, we’re taught that with education, we’re able to further our career path, to have a stable income. How college is crucial to attaining middle to high income, which is the beginning of being successful in life. As the first generation in my family to be attending college, I didn’t know what to expect. There was no guidance when applying to colleges or any advice given relating to college. When I was a freshman, entering college I didn’t know what courses to enroll in or where any of the buildings were. Eventually, we all learn what are general education (GE), Upper Division B: Physical/ Life Science, Upper Division C: Art/ Humanities, upper-division D: Social science and what our major requirements are. Sometimes we have to experience and learn first handed by ourselves so we can be the ones giving advice. "

My mom was the youngest of 7, went to a JC before attending cal poly SLO. She began working at the same company she works at today when she was in college and has worked her way to success. On top of that she got her Masters online while working and raising two kids. She taught me that hard work really does pay off. My dad has always wanted us to use all the resources we have available to us. He wants me to learn the value of hard work and appreciate all the opportunities that I have been able to grow up with. Above all my parents want me to work towards a future that will make me happy. If it wasn’t for them I don’t think I would have even considered going for a doctorate in physical therapy."

I felt so embarrassed to tell them because they pay for me to come and get my stuff done. My mom would always tell me that I need to speak up when I need help because i would fail another class again if not. I looked into tutoring and started to go my professors office hours. Just taking advantage of every help opportunity to be able to understand and pass my classes. My family noticed how much I’ve changed while managing my time and getting the help I needed for classes. And when they seen a change in my grades they were so proud that took their advice. Not only did my family support but my friends did too. I wasn’t going to lie and say I got good grades my first semester so I told them. And they told me the same thing my mom told me. Also that they know I could do it, just need to get off my phone. I’m so happy they spoke up and told me to ask questions and get help because otherwise I would probably not be at state anymore."
