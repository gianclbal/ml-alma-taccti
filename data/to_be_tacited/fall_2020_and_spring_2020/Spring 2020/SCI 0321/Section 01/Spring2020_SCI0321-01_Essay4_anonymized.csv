2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,743,"I will be honest, after a test I forget a lot of the information. But looking back hard enough is when we had a mini lecture on significant figures and how to know how many you need. I will never forget when the professor told us to not use what we did in past chemistry class, which blew my mind because why were we taught it that way then. This way seems harder because I still never remember it. Or that one thing where we drop a number lower, but still keep it there. Sig figs do not make sense to me, why can't I just keep the whole number digits? But for work use, I realize how dangerous it can be if you do not use the correct amount. You can throw off an answer and that can be deadly or not strong enough, for example like pharmacy drugs. "

A topic we covered in Chemistry Quantitative Analysis is using Gas chromatography mass spectrometry  to measure Blood Alcohol levels. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry is a very reliable method for alcohol testing in blood. It is widely used and is considered one the best ways to check for drunk drivers (or DUI).  Two of the techniques that are commonly used for analyzing the gases are direct injection and headspace analysis.  The devise works using a flow-through tube known as the column.  The different chemicals in the sample pass via a gas stream at different rates depending on their interaction with the column’s filling.  As the chemicals exit the end of the column they are detected and electronically identified. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry combines the features of gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify different substances within a test sample.   The instrument is made up of two parts. The gas chromatography portion separates the chemical mixture into pulses of pure chemicals and the mass spectrometer identifies and quantifies the chemicals.  It separates chemicals based on their volatility, or how easily they evaporate into a gas. The chemicals in the mixture separate based on their volatility. In general, small molecules travel more quickly than larger molecules.  The mass spectometry is used to identify chemicals based on their structure. This information is relevant because it helps law enforcement perform their job of collecting evidence for drunk drivers. It benefits society because it helps to keep our roads safe from drunk drivers. Drunk driving is a major factor in accidents on the roadways and many times the accidents result in severe injuries or even death of innocent people."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,711,"What I entered the STEM Field?I entered the STEM field, because I fell in love with it. In high school I was confused what I wanted to do when I was grew up, like I didn’t know if I wanted be an architect or a hematologist or a Mathematician when I got older. I was always changing my goals in life, but it was until I went and took my first biology college classes that I realized that I like it. Just kidding. It took me awhile to fall in love with it. In high school, I took a ton of biology courses, just because there were the only class available and open for high school students. I was a “young scholar” and I went to Cal Poly Pomona while I still attended high school. The entire time I was in these classes, I took really bad teacher that made me want to opt out of biology. But it was until I took a very interesting and awe striking foundational class that made me fall in love with biology but not only biology but with lab research. There was this one experiment, in which I dissected my own DNA, and I saw my DNA under a UV light that made me realized that this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I know understand that this was what I want to do, so now, I’m doing my best to get a degree in the Sciences and be able to see the same thing I saw that"
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,739,"The term ""quantitative analysis"" is often used in comparison (or contrast) with ""qualitative analysis"", which seeks information about the identity or form of substance present. For instance, a chemist might be given an unknown solid sample. They will use ""qualitative"" techniques (perhaps NMR or IR spectroscopy) to identify the compounds present, and then quantitative techniques to determine the amount of each compound in the sample. Careful procedures for recognizing the presence of different metal ions have been developed, although they have largely been replaced by modern instruments."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,744,When we went over the U.S. Standards for Lead levels in food it was very interesting to me how low levels of lead in food made it past the screening process. It seems like humans have a very complex relationship with the element Lead. It's almost like a love hate kind of situation. Because of its unique properties lead has so many applications. But too much exposure to lead could kill us. It makes me sad when you hear stuff on the news about lead in the water supplies of poor communities in America.
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,741,"A concept that was covered in class is near and dear to my heart. This notion of scientific figures never seemed to be important to be because I thought it was insignificant and had no value. However, I was wrong after taking this class. The truth is that significant figures actually say a lot about the value and the meaning of it. Back then, 2.00 and 2 would mean the same to me but apparently it is not when in an analytical setting. The placeholders say a lot especially when dealing with uncertainties whether it is absolute or relative. I never realized that because I never really took an analytical chemistry class that dove deep into the nit picky nature of significant figures. However, I am glad I did because I sure did learn a lot from this class. This concept is important because since I am a chemistry major, I will have to deal with uncertainties a lot. Also, significant figures will help me a lot especially since back then, I used to ignore them or not really pay attention to how many significant figures are present. In my quantitative chemical analysis lab, my professor really stresses the importance of significant figures and sort of implanted this idea of this importance into my head. So now whenever I do anything that deals with numbers, I always have significant figures in the back of my head"
