2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,677,"Huiping Dowdell  Sci 321 Reflective Journaling Essay #3  1 May 2020              The values of my community and my family have had different effects on helping me navigate through college. When I was a young girl, my parents were very strict with me about studying for school. Their main focus on me was to do good in school. Everything else was secondary. I had friends that I played and had fun with, but in the end I had to work very hard to do well in school. I think that part of my family had the greatest influence on helping me learn how to be disciplined in my studying. The values of my family were to put education and studying first. One hard part of navigating through college I have found has been simply being able to do all of the little things like registering for classes, keeping track of important dates, and managing my time schedule. Sometimes these little things can be the hardest to keep track of and can cause the most stress besides studying for regular classes. Luckily I have had some great friends that have experience in going to college and helped me learn how to navigate through all of the administrative requirements involved. The values I learned from them are time management and the importance of being able to stay on top of multiple requirements at the same time. I now have been able to combine my discipline for studying for classes with a discipline for managing my time and keeping up with the administrative side of going through college."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,711,"Week 9I grew up in a very close knit community, in which everyone is out there to help you. For example, whenever my car didn’t turn on, I would ask a neighbor if they would let me borrow their car just to help me hot wire my car. On top of that, if we didn’t have a certain type of vegetable we were able to go ask a neighbor for some. It’s a very caring and a very connected neighborhood that we were able to organize a very spectacular new year party. But in the end, I think my community and my family were able to shape me in a very caring and very helpful person. In which, I’m always looking for ways to help as many people as possible. Therefore, I think it made me a person, that doesn’t mind taking time of there days to help as many people as possible. It’s to the point that it gave me the chance to learn about different people and different personalities. It’s a great way to navigate or network with so many people as possible. Mostly because, everyone is good that certain topic and you never know when there able to help you back. For example, some of my friends that are better in english than me so there able to lend out a helping hand. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,739,"My parents are both college graduates with professional degrees and made it very clear from the beginning that education was very important. I am the youngest of four, so I got see my siblings before me make mistakes and try not to follow them. My parents are also older. My mom was forty when she had me and my dad is ten years older then her. Growing up with older parents provided me with a lot of wisdom and stability that I might not have gotten if I had younger parents. Having that reality I grew up in the suburbs and went to average public schools. I was lucky that my community was very diverse and never really experience racism in school until I went to college. Having parents the were professionals while being a person of color was really inspiring to grow up around. I didn’t really start the appreciating them until I started college but I know see how influential their lectures were on my life. My life could have been a lot worse and it has shaped me to who I am today. I am very lucky for the community and family that I have and have the recourses that I’ve had."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,741,"My personal values are identical to those within the scientific community. I consider myself to be a lifelong learner. I believe that learning is a process that is never ending. This is because you never really stop learning at a certain age since the amount of knowledge out there is almost infinite. I believe that people who are in the field of science feel the same way I do about learning and the idea of it never ending. It's an ongoing day to day process that is happening even at this moment possibly. For example when I write about this journal, I have to think about all the possible things that are related to this topic and then choose the ones that are the most important to this topic. Next, I have to dig deeper and think about certain ideas and in doing so, I learn more about this topic and have a better understanding. This is what I mean by lifelong process. You always learn something new everyday."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,743,"Having a supportive family has made going to college a lot easier. I did not have a choice to attend college, but I still really wanted to and I am having a great time. First year was really rough and I wanted to drop out, but parents would not let me! Thankful for them because I probably would have. They also always ask how school is going, and check in on me. My boyfriend has also made my college experience amazing. He supports me just as much as my parents and will even help me study. He pushes me through the hard days and always makes sure I am okay. My friends back home did not go to college except one, and they do not really understand it, so they do not ask me about it a lot and if I talk to them about it, them never seem interested. But they still support me otherwise and that helps a lot."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,744,"My family and community have helped me navigate through college because they motivate me to go to school and learn and experience new things in life. The community that I grew up in made me want to leave so bad, because I knew it was not the place I wanted to spend my whole life in.  The people I grew up with have made bad choices in life. Luckily I was able to learn from their mistakes and I was able to finally get out of the life that I felt trapped in for  so long. Neither of my parents were educated and it motivated me to get educated because I didn't want to go through my entire life struggling. I hope that one day college will put me in a position where I could help my family and community."
