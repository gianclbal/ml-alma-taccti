2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,739,"Imagine being in a class and everyone understands the subject matter but you? That was me a lot of the time growing up in my math and science classes. Even though I fell in love with science everyone told me that I couldn’t do it. I was told over and over again that I wasn’t smart enough and that I would fail. I used all those negative words against me to fuel a burning fire in my soul to reach my dreams. In STEM there is always something new to figure out and you are surround by a group of people that believe in the impossible. STEM is not easy and I never wanted easy. Being the only African American, and with that female, in my math and science classes, I always felt as if I had a huge target in my back and that every one was waiting for me to fail. And when I did succeed they were angry. What kind of society is that? There needs to be more people of color is the STEM fields so we have some type of representation for our own communities. These are the main reasons that I want to go into the STEM field. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,744,I want to go into my major of chemistry because I love how it is very useful and there is a high demand for chemistry majors. It never made sense to me to go into a major that wasn't in high demand. I cant afford to spend part of my life getting a degree where I might have trouble finding a job later. Although a degree doesn't guarantee anybody a job. It only makes sense to seek out a job that pays well. I don't want to go the rest of my life paying off student loans because the major I chose doesn't pay much. I feel like many degrees are worthless or are the equivalent of a Microsoft excel certificate of completion. I can't see myself doing spreadsheets forever. I like working hands on and in a laboratory.

2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,743,"I want to go into my major, which is biology with a concentration in microbiology, the clinical lab science track so I can work in a lab. I have always wanted to go into the medical field and help others, but I really do not like working with the public. I love science! Biology to be specific. It has always been interesting, because scientists and doctors are always discovering new things and coming up with more evidence to support other theories, or even their own new theory. To me, it seems like a more fun major than other ones, like literature or business. I also am not a good writer, so biology is more for me. I do not have to take a lot of writing classes and that's a major bonus for me. I am very happy I chose my major and stuck with it through my college career."

Additionally, the STEM field includes my favorite subjects. I like science a lot and I really want to find a career in the STEM field. It will be something I will enjoy doing so I want to be able to have a career I can enjoy rather than one I dislike. Since your career is lifetime, you want to do something you like.
