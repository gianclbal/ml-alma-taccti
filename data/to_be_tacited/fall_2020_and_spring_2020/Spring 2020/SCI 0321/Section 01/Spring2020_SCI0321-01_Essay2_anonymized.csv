2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,743,"When life gets challenging for me, I do a lot of things. It really depends on how stressed I am. I either cry, ignore the problem or face it hands on. But it is more of crying and ignoring it. I also have a bad habit of making quick decisions and don’t think it through. Then if that falls apart I will stress out even more and regret my decision. Sometimes I try to write out my problem and see what I can do about it. Life will always get challenging for anyone, all you can do is move on and hope it is just a small problem. One time I thought I lost my dorm keys and started crying at work and called my dad because I thought it was the end of the world (dramatic I know), but they were in my room still. That made me realize crying over it will never help the problem, especially at work. I think I ignore the problem now."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,677,"Huiping Dowdell  SCI 321  13 February 2020  Reflective Journaling Essay #2                                                          What do I do when life gets challenging                  When life gets challenging I normally just bite my lip and face it, and embrace the obstacles.                  This semester is my first semester in a 4 year school. I feel like everyone here is so smart and serious about their studying. I am a student that studies hard and I am always ready before I go to class. But when I get into the class and discuss with my younger classmates about the topics we are going to study for the day, almost everybody already knows a lot about it.  I am surprised sometimes they know more than I do. This makes me realize that I need to study even harder. I felt pressure right away after the new semester started. When I thought about upper division classes, I got the chills. I was scared that I can’t get good grades which would drag down my GPA. This would hurt my chances to get into dental school.                   However, I am so excited to see the support system that our school has set up for the students. I am glad that I have smart helpers like Morgan and Hamed here in the supplementary class. With their help I feel I can face the challenges ahead of me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,739,"When life gets challenging I try to organize my thoughts. I realized a couple of years ago your mind is a very powerful weapon that can either help you or hurt you. I am really big on organizing what is in my control and what is not in my control and then only try to focus on what I can directly control. Life is journey and if you go through it with the intention that things will be easy, then you will have more rude awakening then you probably would want. Another thing I like to do when life gets challenging is to go be in nature. Being in nature helps me feel grounded and I get to meditate a little. Life is genuinely not supposed to be as complicated as we humans have made it, so sometimes it is just nice to sit beneath a tree on sit on some sand and reconnect with yourself. The last main thing that I do is play music. Music for me is very therapeutic and whether I am playing piano or guitar, I am happy. The main thing that one should try to do is find what makes them happy and do it. It is not worth getting tied up in our own negative thoughts."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,744,"When Life gets challenging, I like to clear my mind by taking a long walk in the park. I like to sit on the grass and listen to the sounds of nature. I  think about all  the people that are important to me and I call them, I ask them how they have been. They ask me how I have been. I'll let them know that Life has been challenging and usually they give me some encouraging words and advice. I take that advice and  try it out and it usually works out pretty well. If I'm feeling really depressed I usually go to one of my favorite restaurants and order 2 things so I could eat one plate now and one later. Which gives me time to relax and not cook or clean dishes"

2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,741,"When life gets challenging, I like to roll myself up with the bedsheets and blankets and go on my phone and watch YouTube videos until I fall asleep. The amazing part about this is that it actually works all the time. Whenever I get stressed from deadlines approaching I go to sleep and then wake up realizing I have like no time left so I go on rapid fire mode and do it in an extremely short amount of time. There is a saying, ""diamonds are made under pressure"" and I can say that all my assignments are diamonds because they earn me good grades because of all the pressure I was under. Also, sleeping is always a good answer to everything. It makes everything go away."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,711,"Alma week 6When life gets challenging, I just remember who I am and what my name means to me. I have a lot of pride of who I am and what my name means to me. I’m not a weak minded individual, therefore I don’t let my conscious to take over my own emotions. I have already gone through many devastating events in my life that would have broken me and made me a useless mess but I’m not that person anymore. I’m very sure of myself and that everything I’m doing in my life is because I’m here for a purpose. On top of not letting myself get easily derail, I surround myself with positive energy. I’ve gone through years with individuals that drained my energy and purposely had a negative vibe towards me and it drained me to a depressive state, but I’m not living in that environment anymore. My name is my worth and I’m not letting anyone take my worth away from me anymore. But if there is a time of weakness, I call my mother and get her input around everything and she clears everything up for me. I appreciate her a lot and therefore I’m not bursting from a panic attack."
