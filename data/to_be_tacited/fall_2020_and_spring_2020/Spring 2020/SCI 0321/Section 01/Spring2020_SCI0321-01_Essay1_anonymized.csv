Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,739,"​I am here because after going to a Military School for two and a half years, I wanted to go to a school where I was surrounded by more like minded people where I can be myself. Everyone in life has a purpose and my purpose ultimately was to come to this school. I’ve made plans and goals since I was in the 5th grade, and while my plans rarely played out the way I thought they would, I always ended up reaching my goals and being satisfied at the end of the day. Life is funny like that because in reality we have no idea why we are actually here on Earth itself, and if are perceptions are really reality. The only logical deduction is that everyone who is born is done so with a larger purpose. Some use religion, fate, or science, but what they all have in common is an origin of beginning that the belief stems from. My beginning started in my mother and that is how I am here today. Regardless of my parents I have my own set purpose for who I will interact with during my life and what choices I will ultimately end up making."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,740,"Reflective Journaling Essay #1 “Why am I here”? 	I am here because I believe taking a SCI 321 will help me improve my understanding of CHEM 321 this semester. I have never taken a SCI course before since they often would overlap with my other classes. I do not know how challenging CHEM 321 will be for me, but I know that as with other chemistry courses, it takes a lot of practice to learn. I am confident that SCI 321 will give me the needed practice and help me excel in CHEM 321. The professor may not always have time to cover everything in detail during class time, so SCI 321 is a good opportunity for me to ask more in depth questions and think critically about the material. Also, having former CHEM 321 students as the SCI 321 instructors may help me gain a different perspective of the course that the teacher may not give. I hope that by being here, I am able to improve my learning experience while partaking in something new."

2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,711,"Emilyn Nunez9.19Alma Week 3I’m in college because I know that I can make a change in my community. That everything I do with my life will not only help my family but everyone in my community. I have a drive to do better in a world that constantly belittles my community. I’m not shy to say it how it is and it will drive me to success. The only way that I’m able to create a better future for my community is by getting a PhD and create data dedicated in my community and create policy targeted towards my community. I want to create change and its all about finding ways to make those changes. I’m in love with research and the beautiful ness of my Mexican Community, but we’ve been criminalized and dehumanized, and I want to change that. I’m here because I know that this is the start of everything I want to accomplish. I know that I still have years until I finish my life academically but I know that I want to do everything to help my community. It's funny because I’ve never been happier than I ever been because of  everything I’ve been doing lately. I just know this is what I want to do with my life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,741,"I am here because I want to get a degree. A degree will let me have more options in the future. Some say that college is not necessary to get a good job and I believe that they are correct. However, I disagree with them on the idea where they say that a degree is useless. Many think that but I think otherwise. A degree will allow you to chose from a multitude of pathways rather than just being presented with like 2 or 3 options. I like having a lot of options because I do not like having to chose between two things as it tends to be unfair. Also, I think that college is a good experience. Going to college will let you network with people and make good connections which can go a long way. After all, it's who you know, not what you know. I think that college is a great place to be as it is a melting pot of people and culture. You get to learn about a lot of things and a lot of different ideas which may be new to you."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,742,I am here because I needed the extra units to qualify for financial aid and it worked nicely because it would allow me to work more on CHEm321.
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,743,"I am here because I know I struggle in chemistry classes and really want to do good in Quantitative Chemical Analysis. My major is microbiology, the clinical lab science track, and this was a requirement. I have to get an A or a B. So this sci 321 class is going to help me a lot! I have never taken sci classes because I was lazy or thought I didn't need it. So after hearing how hard this class is, I decided to finally take a class that will help me do good! I already do not like chemistry classes and after a couple classes I realized I would do really bad in quanatiatve chemical analysis if it were not for this sci class. So I am here by choice. I really appreciate the time the instructors take to teach this class because it must be hard for them too, being students. But I am happy with the choice I made and hope they continue offering sci classes."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,677,"Huiping DowDell  Science 321 – Reflective Journaling Essay #1  6 February 2020  “Why am I here?”              I am here at SFSU as a transfer student majoring in Biochemistry. I attended College of Marin before transferring this spring. My goal is to complete my BS here at SFSU and then attend dental school. My ultimate goal is to become a dentist and work here in the bay area.              I am here at this Science 321 supplemental class for Chemistry 321 so that I can hopefully improve my performance in Chem 321. I have a pretty good background in chemistry. I have already taken General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry I and II. I really enjoyed these classes and found them to be challenging. Chemistry 321 is my first time taking chemistry at SFSU, so I want to use this supplementary course to help me do my best. I expect this supplementary course to give me a chance to build on what I have learned in the lectures from Chemistry 321, and I hope it gives me the opportunity to ask questions about things I’m not sure about from the Chemistry 321 lectures."
2020,Spring,SCI 0321,SI,1,744,I signed up for 2 SCI classes this semester because in the past SCI  courses have really improved my learning. My very first semester at San  Francisco State University I took a total of 3 SCI courses and it was my  best semester GPA to date. Since that semester my GPA has not been as  good. It was that first semester that has been holding my overall GPA  over a 2.0 average. So this semester I needed something to change so  I've decided to go back to what worked for me in the past. So far I've  been having a great semester for the first time in a long time I finally  dont feel like Im behind in all my classes. It is a great feeling and I  hope there are more SCI courses offered here for my upper division  classes. I really enjoy learning in this type of environment.
