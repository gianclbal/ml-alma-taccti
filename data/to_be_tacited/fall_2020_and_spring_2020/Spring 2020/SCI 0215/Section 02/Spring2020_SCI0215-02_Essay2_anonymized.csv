2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,627,"It is never easy when life gets challenging. Usually I get really stressed out when challenges appear in my life. I always feel overwhelmed and like I can't control things that happen in my life. But I usually lean on someone I know I can trust and vent how I feel as well as try to calm myself down. I will try to overcome challenges by creating a sort of mental game plan, whether it is a schedule to or how I can destress myself while facing the specific challenge. Usually my challenges are time management related, so it is easiest for me to try to lay out some sort of schedule a couple of days ahead to give myself realistic time frames for when I can put my energy into things like school work or social gatherings. Sometimes when my schedule does not work out exactly as planned, I have to sacrifice my sleep and stay up late to get school work done."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,634,"When life gets challenging, I tend to cope in many different ways. Whether that is hanging with friends, getting sleep, listening to music, taking a bath, taking a break from responsibilities, etc. I like to hang out with people that make me feel stress free from work and watch shows or simply hang out and listen to music, just have a good time. I also love looking into self care methods and reading quotes/poetry to give me words of inspiration or wisdom. I try to meditate sometimes as well. Going to the gym has always been a big thing for me as well and going to the sauna to meditate there afterwards. It helps me get distracted by making me focus on doing something like a workout for a period of time and my body feels better afterwards as well. Going out to the city to explore, having things to look forward to. In general within myself, when times get tough, I try to recollect myself and watch how I react to stress because I am aware that most stress comes from how we react to situations."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,533,"What Do I Do When Life Gets Challenging.When life gets challenging, first I simply accept it. Accept it and face it as I do with all my other tasks. I want to talk about most recently the pandemic and specifically how challenging it is too remote to online courses and learning. This is an example of when life is challenging. One I accepted it and I knew there wasn't something I can do to change it. I adjust very quickly. I set up even more planner/calendars with the exact due dates and when I cant get to an assignment I try to make sure I don't forget about it and accept its okay to do it later rather than never. When life gets hard I talk to my mother as my emotional support partner I talk things out with her and we find solutions to everything. We never leave things on a bad note. And that's how I deal with a challenge in my life. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,630,"Lubat Asadova SCI 216March 16, 2020At times when life gets challenging, I try to cope with it by taking a step back for reflection based on examination and consider resources and choices available to be inquired or found. SF State has many useful resources and tries to keep students engaged. I feel safe to talk about my challenges and find ways to deal with them. I quite enjoyed making new friends and learning new material and resources. In terms of chemistry, there were some topics that I wanted to be explained more in-depth rather than just using the given formula, therefore I enrolled in the SCI 216. It sounds like a good resource to have that extra study especially if it is a study group with the upper-class facilitators. In addition, through my experience, the best way to deal with the challenge is to ask for help or simply ask questions about things that are troubling or confusing. But, this requires patience, persistence, and effort."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,639,"What do I do when life gets challenging? When things in my life begin to get challenging, I like to take a step back from whatever I am doing at that moment and take a deep breath and calm my mind. I find that to be very useful and very beneficial to my mental health. Something else that I do when things get frustrating in my life is to put my earbuds on and listen to rain or relaxing music, this helps me clear whatever is on my mind. People that help me calm down when things get challenging is my mom because she knows how to get my mind off things and relax. This reflection was beneficial to me to think about because this is something that happens to me frequently because I am very impatient and I tend to be a perfectionist which can make things challenging when things don’t go the way I wanted it to."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,76,"When life gets challenging I take a minute to concentrate on myself and focus on what works best for me in order to continue what I do. Being a part time sales supervisor and going to school almost every day gets very stressful and challenging because I feel like I have no time to complete certain assignments and take time for myself since it does get very tiring. However, I start to think about how fortunate I am to have a job and receive great education that others do not have due to the circumstances that they may be in which makes me thankful for the opportunities I have. When life gets challenging I also turn to my family and friends for advice which is really helpful and makes me happy to know I have a great support system and people I can depend on no matter what. They give me hope because they tell me that anything is possible and I get can get through it with time and patience. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,584,"When life gets challenging I begin to have a million thoughts running through my head. I then begin to freak out, and panic. However, over the years I've learned to deal with such afflictions. I first get something to eat and relax for about thirty minutes. Then, I start to make a list of what needs to be done, what I need to learn/overcome and then make a plan to accomplish the task. To accomplish the task I either communicate with my professor for clarification, use tutoring services, or contact a peer. Then when I have all the materials I need at my disposal I begin to work undisturbed until the task is complete. Should challenges still persist, then I go for a one on one session with a tutor or professor. Or I contact a SCI 215 professor for advice. Every semester I always try to have as many resources available, so that challenges become minor obstacles instead of problems. Thus reducing my level of stress/anxiety. I also talk with several other resources like my professor for physics to work out a plan if my original study plan is not working. For example, I was faced with the challenge of having my SCI 215 course not correlated with my instructors lesson plan. It was difficult, and currently I am working on a study plan with my SCI 215 facilitators to remedy any inconsistencies in my understanding of the material. "

2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,640,"First: I try to reflect backwards, with things I've overcome, failed, and ""works in progress"".I think the strongest skills I have up to this point was due to certain things happening to me that is unique to my own failures and lifestory. Those same mistakes/failures/obstacles, are my strengths/advantages. I've met many great people. I have learned to love myself, and motivate myself.I have many periods where I lack the motivation to do anything. This 1st week of remote learning was the most challenging academically, I've never experienced such procrastination and frustration over 1 week of remote learning. I am trying to forgive myself through the mistakes I've made so far in the remote learning process. Most importantly, during this chaotic time, I know I have support from my professors, friends, and SCI instructor peeps. I think the coolest/inspiring moments were my interactions with my professors during this transition. They were PULLING THROUGH during their first Zoom meetings, and had effectively respond to my personal requests/questions. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,638,"What do I do when life gets challenging? If you mean academically or mentally, I keep persistent. I am a naturally stubborn person, so it takes much to offend or bother or worry me. You would be surprised what does upset in contrast to the norm. If you mean financially, which I never had problems with, I would live tighter to the wallet. If physically, then I would assess whether I have been keeping hydrated and getting my 7-8 hours of sleep. Routine is my key to stability and overcoming obstacles and at the base of that is keeping organized. Having everything in order and in line has kept me on a successful tract. The number one thing though is the people I surround myself with. I learned at an early stage in my life to cut off those who were an anchor and would not help me ascend in any way. It is when my life becomes challenging is when it becomes interesting. Then I grin. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,541,"There are many things I do when life gets challenging, whether it's because of work, or school I find different ways towards these solutions. As a mariachi, I usually tend to either one listen to mariachi music and all the songs I sing to boost my ego when I’m feeling down or if I need to release stress I tend to grab my guitar and play songs. I also do a lot of self-care things when I feel like I need to relax I tend to go to the store and buy face masks or lotions. Another thing that I do is hang out with my friends and watch movies. If it's sunny outside I tend to go out and enjoy the little bit of sunshine we’re getting. If it's not sunny in SF I tend to drive towards Santa Cruz or seaside where there are beaches and it's nice and warm."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,633,"When life gets challenging I tend to give into my bad thoughts which put me in a bad mood but besides my mood it also gets me thinking on solutions to overcome these challenges. In order to get rid of my bad mood however I usually play video games, listen to music, draw, watch youtube , or I tell my girlfriend what is on my mind and all those things do help me but what helps me most of all is talking to my girlfriend because she reassures me that things will sort themselves out in the end or she will tell me that I can overcome the challenge and she will help me or that she will be there to morally support me and I really, really appreciate everything she does for me when life gets tough because without her I don't know what I would do and I don't think that I would be where I am today without her. Another thing is that I overthink about thing at hand and I stress myself out doing that and my girlfriend is always there to tell me to no stress over thing I have no control over and that gets me to stop worrying and it gets me to realize that she is right and in the end things do end up sorting themselves out and the outcome makes me think about why I was even stressing myself out in the first place."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,642,"When life gets challenging, I just go to people or do something to de-stress. Some things I do are playing video games to not think about what is challenging in life or just go shopping and to talk to family. I think it's a learning opportunity when life gets challenging because you learn a new way to do it. I don't think life is challenging right now but I know it's going to be in the future because life throws you curveballs all the time.  Also another thing I would do when life gets challenging is just have a stress ball with me at all times. I would use the stress ball for a few minutes then rethink about what to do to turn the challenging situation into something that I can do. Stress balls are really good for you when life is challenging and you need some destresser in life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,632,When life gets challenging I always try to take a step back and not react or think on impulse. I access the situation and see what could be done to resolve the issue at hand or what steps I can take to relief some of my stress. It is easier said than done at times because sometimes times are really tough but for the most part it has helped me. I am currently struggling with my time management and with dealing with this new online version of classes and constantly have to try to remind myself of certain lectures at certain times. I feel as if I have been falling quite behind on certain assignments for classes but I am heading back to my apartment in San Francisco where I will be home alone and will have the time and ability to focus and do all of my school work. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,643,"When life gets challenging I usually take a step back and reassess what is going on. Usually if I keep moving forward without taking a step back I get extremely  unmotivated and feel unable to function. This affects me in more ways that one because a lack of getting things done usually makes the cycle even more stressful. Alternatively, I also have a few stress relief things I do. For example, I like giving myself little spa days or organizing the music I listen to. Sometimes I just go out and have a good day with some friends. When I am super stressed I sometimes forget to do these little things so I have an app on my phone to remind me. If the thing stressing me out is studying, I take small breaks in between and watch a video or something and then get back to work. This helps me stay away and a bit more motivated."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,628,"For me, when life gets challenging it depends on what terms exactly the challenge is happening. If it’s in school life I usually ask for any help from my teachers, fellow classmates or friends to help me in any of the challenging assignments, tests, quizzes, or homeworks that I can not do myself. If I am not able to find any help I use chegg if its a science or math subject but if it is another subject then I would use the internet to look for assistance, I usually go for in person help since i would get to ask questions so the next time i get this challenge it would not be as difficult. If it is life I would just try to hang out more with my friends, leave whatever is making life challenging and try to focus on more fun things for the moment then of course get back to it"
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,626,"When life gets challenging, I usually take a breather. I stop whatever I am doing and take a few deep breaths. It keeps me from not getting frustrated or trying to give up. Having positive thoughts in my mind helps to keep me from pushing forward. Usually thinking of my family and how much they put effort on me to attend schools. Mainly my little brother who looks up to me dearly. Other ways when life gets challenging is to listen to music. Otherwise, I just don't feel the confidence in myself. It is important for me to take care of my mental health before I continue a challenge. That is why music really helps me clear my head. I usually listen to lofi music because if the calmness or pop to keep me upbeat. I play music when I am bored as well because it makes me stay focus on whatever task I am doing."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,637,"When life gets challenging the ultimate realization I tend to have is to try to create a plan to move forward. Many times this is easier said than done. The path to seeing a way through a challenge is not always clear. A school challenge for instance, may have some intense moments of panic, and inability to see a positive result. However, doing something, even the smallest step forward, tends to work out better than just sitting paralyzed in panic. If I’m able to get to the other side of panic, I can then start to focus on what are the things I do have control over, and move forward little by little from there. Talking with friends and peers also seems to help mitigate some of the fears that come with challenging situations. Getting a different perspective may be the breakthrough needed to overcome a challenging issue. And when all else fails, there is always professional therapy; which has been immensely helpful."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,629,"What do I do when life gets challenging?  When I was in high school and life got challenging, I used to give up and hope all of my problems will be solved.  For example, I used to have difficulty with calculus in high school and whenever a concept was hard, I would look up the answers to the homework and tell myself that I could just learn it later.  I ended up failing that class and it really stressed me out.  After that I had to change my whole outlook and change my ways when life gets challenging.  When life gets challenging i will take a step back and reflect on what is hard and try to find a way to solve it.  I would tell myself that there is a solution for everything so that it can raise my spirits and increase my chances of succeeding.  To deal with the stress that comes with these challenges, I tend to go outside for a walk for about ten minutes while listening to some soothing music.  I have realized that every time life gets challenging you won't always succeed in overcoming those challenges.  As long as I know I gave it all I got, I will be okay with the results. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,574,"Angela Orellana-SanchezMarch 16,2020When life gets challenging, I start to read to try to get my mind distracted. As of right now I have been reading the bible and a book named creative transformation by John David Garcia. That has been my life saver but I will have to say it, when all of the nonsense gets to me and I can't seem to go anywhere to hide from it but to cope with it. I go for a run and not just for a regular run, I go run the hills and I start air punching the floor or the sky to let out all my frustrations out. It is frustrating and upsetting when you can't do anything in this world for your family and friends. When you know you are only 22 years old and your level of intellectual knowledge is not at it's peek and you know for a fact that no one will take you seriously because you aren't in this ""mature level"" where they can take you seriously. Its frustrating but in the mean time I will work hard on myself where I know one day I will get to that point where people will start to take me seriously. In any case when life does get challenging, I start to focus on how to better myself so that I can overcome such challenges like this because this isn't knew to me at all. this is only another obstacle in life that we all must overcome and how we get overcome it is up to us.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,635,"When things get difficult, there are a lot of ways that a person can do to get over them. Personally I tend to sort issues and priorities around how I can be rewarded and relieved after I solve or complete them. School work and work in general comes first, family and personal issues second, and everything else last.  Of course family first, but sometimes work and school work can be taken care of easily before family. But whatever has the most tasks and rewards after the duty is complete that’s usually what I sort first. I think it's weird that I organize the rewards before the work but knowing that I have something to work toward pushes me to go forward. There are times where I would be really stuck, physically and mentally but by keeping in mind that there’s another time and that there other options that I can resort to. There always have and always is, no matter how risky or how long those options would take, there are ways to adapt to challenges presented to me and to every one. If filtering out my issues or re evaluating my priorities can’t help it, there are people that can help, if that can't help then maybe time. Maybe I do need a break, maybe I need to work on smaller tasks first before I can work on the bigger problems. Maybe the other way around, in the end things just sort out for themselves and the next challenge comes forth after. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,581,"When life gets challenging, I tend to sit back and force myself to take a look at the bigger picture. I need to pause and reflect on what is going on. It is important to look at each thing that is happening, then one by one, conquer each of them, if possible. It helps to make a to-do list, even if it is just for small things like rearranging a binder. Other than that, it is important to take time for yourself. We need to take a break and evaluate how we feel before it gets to be too intense. With that, we need some selfcare to make sure we can perform to the best of our ability. Taking a minute out of every day to focus on your breathing can help. When life gets challenging, it is important to pause, reflect, and react in a proper manner that benefits you."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,636,"What do I do when life gets challenging?When life gets challenging I tend to reflect and my goals and my purpose in life. I take things one step at a time and focus on the present. I put forth my best effort and work ethic in order to achieve results. I acknowledge challenges as learning experiences and try to overcome them in order to grow and learn as an individual. In addition, I turn to my spirituality and count my blessings daily especially when life gets challenging.I constantly remind myself that the outcomes of the obstacle do not define me as an individual. But the manner in which I conduct myself in the situation reflects my maturity. Life isn't always supposed to be fun there are moments that are challenging. By facing the challenge I feel that I have power over the situation and that I’m responsible for the outcome. It also important that I don’t allow this particular issue to affect all aspects of my life. Also, life is like a  test that you're never fully prepared just do your best to pass. Taking responsibility for my actions is a part of adulthood and living with the consequences is part of life. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,641,"What I do when life gets challenging is I either go skateboarding around Embarcadero or take pictures around my neighborhood or school. I just did that recently and it was very helpful. I do other things also, but these two or the ones that help me the most. Skateboarding makes me feel free, especially on a nice day because I can see people walking around the area and the same goes for dog walkers too. Looking at the different breeds of dogs and how some are mixed. It helps me better when I am taking pictures and someone joins me. someone to talk to about something important recently or just having a laugh. Also, gives me a chance to get better as a photographer because I do more landscape photos then portrait photos of people. It is nice taking pictures in Golden Gate Park because there is animals, such as frogs, ducks, birds, and surprisingly a crustacean."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,625,"When life gets challenging I do tend to get stressed but I try to not find ways to stress less. For example I do get stressed if I have an exam and a lot of assignments that are due the same time. To avoid that much pressure on myself I try to manage it. I usually try to finish all my assignments at the beginning of the week and then just focus on studying for my exam. Another example of what I do when life gets hard is going to the gym. I found that the gym helps me release a lot of the stress that I feel. It also gives me a break of not using my phone or doing school work and just focus on myself and health. Lastly, I try to get a good amount of sleep in. When I do feel anxious or when everything feels a lot harder that usually I tend to stay up late and I find myself overthinking the situation and feeling very tired the next day. But I try to avoid that habit and try to get a good amount of sleep so I don't feel horrible/ miserable  the next day."
