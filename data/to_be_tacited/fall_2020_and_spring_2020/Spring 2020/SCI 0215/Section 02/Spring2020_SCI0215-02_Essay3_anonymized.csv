2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,631,"My family values each other which leads to a lot of focus and talk about health, school life for younger members, etc. Looking at the health part, I realized that I have always wanted to figure out the ""why""s and ""how""s of the many health problems that we have in our family. This is how I knew I wanted to pursue a career as someone who does medical research. I know my family also values academic achievement and it kind of puts a lot of pressure on me as I'm the first to go to college in my family. The only other person that went to college was my mom's sister who I haven't seen much growing up and I don't really receive help from her so at times I feel like I'm going through this on my own. My family is really big on helping one another so I have my grandparents who financially support me most with school and I try my best in school to show them that it’s all worth it at the end and I’ll show them my grades and all my achievements."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,636,"My family values of hard work and strong work ethic have allowed me to navigate through college. Being a STEM major is challenging and having life skills like a great work ethic, patience, persistence is an additional strength. I have managed to use these lessons that I’ve learned and applied it to my courses. My community has taught me teamwork and the vale of individual growth. By reflecting on my experiences I feel that I have a greater understanding of myself as an individual and my goals. I’ m motivated and focused through college.Knowledge is a skill that attained through education. The importance of an education was instilled in me at a young age from my family and community. Sharing knowledge and information helps build an informed society. The pursuit of an education is a journey that requires patience and determination to overcome obstacles that may occur. By understanding that these obstacles are apart of the learning journey."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,633,"The values of my community have allowed me to navigate through college by finding support, motivation and humility in the importance of an education. when I first arrived to SFSU I was living with my relatives and they gave me shelter and a place to begin my education and it reminded me when they first arrived in San Francisco as immigrants they had little to no shelter and no connections to other people but with time and hard work they managed to be in a better place and build connections with people and that's how I am here at SFSU today. This reminds me to remain motivated in my studies because even though it may not seem like it, my relatives made sacrifices in order to help me achieve a better education and along with realizing that it gave me motivation, support, and humility. I will never forget these three values that my community and family have taught me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,637,"I feel like many people in my life put a lot of value in higher education; however there is so much more that comes with going to college than just getting a degree. If you do not have all you need to figure out how to accomplish those other societal needs than that makes completing college a much harder task. A big part of me navigating college is by actually shedding the values of those around me, and focusing on what is best for me. This included knowing when to take a step back from school to focus on other aspects of my life that needed more attention at the time. Don’t get me wrong, there have been family, friends and peers in my life that have been wonderful cheerleaders of support, and study buddies; but when it comes down to it, it has ultimately been up to me to motivate myself and push forward."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,634,"My family has helped navigate me through college by motivating me to not give up on my school work. I had struggled growing up dealing with my own mental health and my family did their best to remind me that no matter what I pursued that as long as I was happy with what I was doing that I am able to accomplish whatever it is that I dream to do. I always thought that I had to pursue a certain career in order to be successful to meet the expectations of my parents since they were able to have financially stable jobs and be able to send my brothers and I to college and have a home. So I struggled with my mental health but they helped me by continuing to believe in me, and I was able to be where I am today with their unconditional love and support."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,533,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?My community, my friends and family have been a major reason I am in college and I’m doing good. My community is where I call home and whenever I’m going through something difficult I can always give my family and friends a call to get advice and have my feelings expressed. I haven’t been a very religious person but I do value my religion and pray for good health. Once when I was having a hard time in college with financial aid and homesickness I really depended on my community my family to navigate through it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,640,"Shoutout to my friends, SCI instructors, and professors I've met up to this point. Y'all the MVPS.Catch me listening to Spanish Reggaeton while studying. Catch me taking Rumba classes at the Mashouf Center. See me enjoy my Salvadorian Papusas and Mexican tacos/burritos/nachos, at the local tacquerias near my house!!!!!!!!! Catch me singing multiple Asian languages at Karaoke places: I could sing in Japanese, (Gibberish) Korean, and Cantonese/Mandarin!!!! In the future, I'm looking forward for travels around Europe and Asia. Volunteer abroad someday.Find me asking people about the specifics of their ethnic background and their life stories!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Find me talking to my Uber/Lyft drivers for this specific reason It's cool being bi-culturally raised (Chinese and the American culture), because this upbringing helped me understand what being in a diverse community of cultures and ethnic groups. It has helped me become empathic, curious, and patient with people of different nationalities outside of my ethnic group.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,638,"Values are important and are the foundation of a person’s identity. Our own personal values guide us through our lives whether they be theological or societal or anything else. My biggest value is education and I treat it as an umbrella term. I do not just refer to an academic environment, but also real-life experience. To educate one’s self, or to learn a new topic, requires discipline and commitment. These attributes go hand-in-hand. I am a big believer that if one sows a true, hardy education, then they will reap the fruit of wisdom. Corny as that might sound, “knowledge is power” is my value. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,635,"Back in high school there were plenty of programs and people inspiring kids to help them get into college, as if it was the only way to make a living. I was taught that college was the next step after high school, but there were other routes too. They guided me to take SAT exams, and explained their importance to college and taking extracurricular classes to make myself look better on applications. In terms of my family they mostly never helped me other than moral support, I’m a first born, first generation, first college student of my immigrant family. And for the most part, I have been doing everything myself. It feels like I'm blindly getting myself into this college thing hoping that it is a good decision. Navigating through college is tough, sometimes I wonder if I'm doing the right thing or making the right decisions. The only ones who can tell me what’s right and wrong are those guidance counselors and colleagues with similar classes and majors as me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,581,"My family values have helped guide me through college by teaching me to be strong and push through each and every challenge that crosses my path. A lot of my family went to college but majored in things other than what I am studying. My family looks at the topics I cover in class and gets too overwhelmed. She tells me to keep pushing, but “she could never do” what I am doing. My family supports me, but they support from a distance. They just tell me to do my best. Because my family either did not go to college or studied something unrelated to what I am learning in college, they do not really understand it and kind of avoid talking about it. It is always “just do your best”, but I guess that’s some pretty solid support. My grandma always wanted me to go to college and I feel like I am doing this for her and I. She and my great grandpa always had a goal for me to become a doctor and like a rebellious kid, I said I never wanted to be one. After going to college for a few years, I realized how interested I was in the human body and its functions. They were the beginning point of my values and taught me to push myself as a child which carries me through life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,630,"Lubat Asadova Reflective Journaling Essay #3April 3,2020The values of my family definitely played a role in navigating me through college. My family is from the Middle East. The community is known for respect, hospitality and support to the close ones. My family values persistence and effort due to the life experiences that my parents have faced in their life. My mother was a cotton picker as a college student pursuing a degree in biology and my father was a farmer and responsible to raise his siblings. They both learned to be persistent and embed effort to succeed and start a new life in USA from the hardships they faced in their life. I want to honor their hard work and sacrifices done for me by going to the STEM field. I am applying the perseverance into my academics to be able to reach my aspirations. Also, when I stock with a challenge, I chose to not quit knowing that even after failing there is a chance to start over and keep going. Many times, the conversations or even just telling my concerns and achievements to my mom gives me the support to work harder and enjoy my life.  My family helped me a lot to pursue my goals."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,629,"How have the values of my community or my family (of origin or of choice) helped me navigate through college?  So far in my journey through college, I have encountered certain challenges.  For example, a challenge I am dealing with right now is this Calculus 1 class.  This is my second time taking this course, and I am having difficulty passing this course.  However, the values of my family, are helping me through this hard time in my college career.  The first value that is helping me through college, is not giving up.  So far this value is pushing me to the limit, so that I don't give up and I can succeed in this course.  Every time I feel like giving up on this course, I can hear my family's voices in my head to not give up and to keep trying until I succeed no matter what.  The second value that is helping me through college is to stay positive.  This value in my opinion, goes hand in hand with persevering, because if you are negative throughout a situation, how can you ensure that you won't give up on the task at hand.  To me I believe that this is the most important value helping me navigate throughout college."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,584,"The values of my community/family have helped navigate college by instilling within me the desire to first want a degree. They helped me realize the importance of hard work and utilizing the resources and opportunities that are available. It isn't enough to work hard, a person must be able to work smart by maintain good time management skills. Of which, I am not exactly the greatest. I still struggle with time management. But it is something that I am working on, and will continue to work on. Physics, Science, and Chemistry, I find these subjects to be a very labor intensive process. In order to do well, I have to put in the time to carefully understand the material. Currently I am working on doing just that. Other than teaching me the value of hard work, I find that my family hasn’t helped me in navigating through college, because at the end of the day, college is both a social and solitary experience. Social in the sense we are communicating with professors and fellow peers to a certain extent, however it is very solitary in the sense that I’ve found necessary information isn’t really presented to students in the right way. Just last semester learned that we have certain services available to us students. This includes but is not limited to, the students association, carp/lac tutoring, a school provided therapist. All these resources are not widely shared, and I feel like college is more of getting to know your institution first and how everything works before any real academics can start. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,541,The values of my family have been a huge impact throughout my life and every time I’ve ever made a decision it has been because of my family. As a first-generation college student being able to break barriers and being able to help my siblings when they need help. Coming from a Hispanic/Latino heritage I have learned to love and value everything that I have and will always have. I have learned the importance of valuing education and prioritizing the opportunities I have been given but also enjoy the opportunities that life throws at you. Throughout the years I have persevered through different situations and different issues that I’ve dealt with personally but I have always kept my head high and persevered through it all. I have never given up no matter how hard things get I will never give up because that's something my parents have taught me.
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,632,"The values of my community as well as the values of my family have helped me navigate through college. I come from a predominantly Mexican community and a Mexican household, therefore, I think with the values of my culture. My family has this saying that says ""Ponte las pilas"" which translates to put on your batteries in English. It pretty much serves as an encouragement to do better and work hard and it is something my parents always tell me when I tell them that I am struggling or stressed with school. Aside from sayings, I have the mentality that nothing is meant to be handed to us. Hard work pays off and grants us what we want and need and it is exactly what has helped me when I want a good grade in a class, I make sure that I put in the work and time to achieve that goal."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,76,"The values of my community or my family helped me navigate through college because my family has always told me how important it is to go to college and do what I love and become successful. They have always supported me and made sure I was confident in the college I chose to go to even if it wasn’t in the city and would be more financially difficult, but they say having a good education is the most important because it does benefit your future and life. I am not the first one to attend college, most of my cousins and sister all graduated from SF State which gives me the strength and confidence that I can do it too, despite all of the challenges that come along with it. I know I can always turn to them for advice because they have all been through it and know the process. Since I was a little kid I knew I was going to go to college because that is what I was constantly told and did go to a middle school and high school that would prepare me for what was expected and that it does get difficult at times and should be taken seriously. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,627,"My family has always made it clear that I would be going to college. From a young age they told me how important college was and my dad even told me where he wanted me to go to school. I never thought there were any other options other than going to college and getting my bachelor’s degree. So for me, even though my parents did not know anything as far as how to navigate through college and finding my way with classes and college in general, I always knew that I wanted to graduate college. Making my family proud is one source of motivation for me to find my way and do well in my classes, but I also want to make myself proud as well. My values of course started with my family but ended up shaping my own similar views on college. This is where I find my strength to keep going."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,626,"How my family helped me navigate through college was by keeping the environment positive. Meaning everyone only speaking on positive thoughts because it is a motivation to keep pushing through. Being able to tell them things about school and what I am doing makes them so proud of me. That is what navigates me throughout college, to make my parents proud of me. It also keeps me in check because I know from what my parents have showed me from what is right and wrong. Also having the guidance of my sister when I was younger. Having to be inspired by your big sister and watching her become who she is as a woman showed me to be confident with myself. Looking at her mistakes through school, and picking herself back up until she graduated at UC Davis. It might have took her a couple of years, but she pushed through. So my family has helped me through my navigation through college. By looking at their mistakes and their achievements, and learning how to become my own person. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,639,When I sit back and ask how the values of my community and family have helped me navigate through college I believe the values of my family have helped me get through college so far because ever since I was little I wanted to go to a 4 year college. School has always been very important to me. My mother only graduated high school and my father only did two years in college. I feel like because my parents pushed me and my siblings to do good in school so it motivated me to do more than just get a high school diploma. I think the values of my community also help me navigate through college because in society now it is very encouraged to go to college and get a degree because it can be challenging to get a good paying job without a college education. Also with my dream occupation you don't need a 4 year degree but I want to push myself to do the best I can because I have always been motivated as a child. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,628,"The values of my community have helped me navigate, through college, was the Latino community. The Latino community encourages each other that we need to show the United States that we are capable of graduating from college and that we are not people of war or crime but the exact opposite. Also my classmates and friends also help me navigate through the tough college life by getting us to work together to either study, or also do homework together to figure problems out together. Also when we show each other the knowledge of what we know so that the others that do not know can be helped by us going through what was discussed in class a lot easier rather than if one were to do it all by themselves. Of course that could also be by your diverse classmates, but in my highschool this was the case, but here in college metro also made it the case as well"
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,642,"My family beliefs and values helped me navigate my way through college. I don't think my community values helped me in any way though. This semester, this course I am taking told me one thing that stuck in my head which was what you put into the course, is what you take out of the course. So putting in effort means that you will get a better outcome in the end. I strongly believe in that because if you don't put effort, then you are just wasting your time. Also, I learned from my cousins that you just go with the flow. So whatever happens happens. Other than those, I can not think of anything else. But when the semester first started office hours, EOP and youtube videos really helped me because some materials I didn't understand, so going to office hours and youtube videos helped me out a ton. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,643,The community and my family both value hard work and take pride in bettering yourself. These values instilled themselves in me and everything I ever do in life I put the utmost effort into it. We also didn’t value giving up on something. Because of that I choose to persevere in times of hardship such as the one we are facing right now. These values together helped me get into college and survive my first semester and they are helping me survive this one. We value education above everything else because that is the one thing that can better almost anyone. Knowledge is power and that is the message I show every single person I interact with on a daily basis. The value of education is something that I see people either weigh more or less importance on based on their family values and their own values but for me and my family it has always been our number one priority to have the education which allows us to better ourselves and the people around us. It helps us survive more than any other thing.
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,574,"Angela Orellana-SanchezSci- ChemistryIn my family college is extremely important. School comes first and given that all of my uncles and aunties graduated from college, they were considered first generation, you can imagine how competitive my cousins are. My mom comes from 8 siblings and they all went to UCLA and had children ( cousins). Most of my cousins went to IVY leagues. However, in my immediate family, my father (UC San Diego) engineering assistant, brother ( UC Davis ) biomedical engineer, big sister (Johns Hopkins) physician, since we are involved in the sciences.. I always had a hard time catching up. There is  a lot of pressure to be the best in our family and at times it has taken a toll but none of the less, having a loving family is important and I believe because of my parents philosophy of how to bring up children comes from a much more loving alternative and not so controlling. I have managed to feel comfortable enough to be proud of how I have managed myself through college.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,641,"It's really hard to say because my family really motivated to attend college or university, but I don't think they were quite ready for me to leave. They prepared me with basic survival skills that most of generation lack, such as, cooking, work/ job, keeping a room or house clean, and especially washing, drying and folding cloths. Attending San Francisco State University allowed me multiple opportunities, but as I mentioned before it's hard that family helped because none of my family members live in the bay area so they were unable to help me. I'm not going to lie that they didn't, they did, just with little amount. Luckily, the one true value that I'm happy that my family passed on to me is being a people person. Due to this, it helped me make friends in the city and school. Have a better connection with those in the same or similar major as I am. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,625,"My family is from Eritrea, and I was born and raised in San Jose, Ca. I was always around the people that are from my community. On the weekends we would all get together and learn how to speak/ write in Tigrinya (one of the languages spoken in Eritrea). We would also have special guests that would introduce themselves to us and explain what they do as their career. For example, one of the speakers that spoke to us is Haben Girma who is a famous deaf and blind advocate. We also had different people who were engineers, doctors, and even college students. So at a young age my community and family taught me how important getting an education was. Fastwording today, my family has been a big help navigating me through college. My dad went through college and graduated so that was also a big help when I was first entering college."
