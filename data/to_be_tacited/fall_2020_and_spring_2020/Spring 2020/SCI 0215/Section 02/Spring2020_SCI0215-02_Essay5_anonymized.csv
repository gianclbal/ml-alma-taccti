2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,630,"Lubat Asadova I always loved STEM. The field is evoking me. Si, I chose Biochem as my major because i get to feel diffrent since classes that have a great impact with regorus cirriculum. The multiple variabilities and its own significance in the lives of the human gives me motivation and joy to study Biochem. I want to explore all aspects of the filed for the hope to find myself and recognize the cool things that might be new or more in-depth to appreciate the world I am living and my interactions with other beings. Furthermore, I am confident that my professional job will be related to Biochem. I thinking to be scientici researcher or work in biootech. I want to succeed or if not just love what I do. And so far, I can say that I do like all my courses especially all the science and math classes that I am taking my first year of college. My attitude toward the subject and work is not just to receive a degree but be present to the fullest and apply my knowledge to something that I care about or do. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,640,"This challenging time has tested my patience as well as my sanity. Staying up past the morning has been part of my schedule, with some costs on my personal end... but has been getting some work done when necessary. I am normally very positive pre-quarentine, but this event has done a signifigant dive to my own self-esteem, while highly triggering my levels anxiety with caffiene. I've been frequently more irritated, frustrated (to the point of cursing at a computer screen, esp over Chemistry homework), and lost 50% of my appetite for a few days over the amount of stress, anxiety, and lack of sleep.This was exactly what I was reflecting at 5am, during a restless/anxious time of this semester. I honestly don't have the grades or the natural intelligence to get through my classes, nor able to get to the best programs, but, I hope my passion to help others will overcome that someday. I've teared up everytime thinking about how little I've done at this point for others around me, yet, they're visibly showing positive results when I try to help. I want to naively stick with this future outlook about myself... I strongly believe that at this point, this is my ""personal calling"", as my cell biology professor has remarked in person. I want to naively convince myself that my grades don't matter over this competitive field.I look up to my friends who have now either been working for a few years professionally, or continuing on with medical school (bless their struggling hearts and souls). I never knew what a white coat ceremony was until I saw one of my classmates going thru it. Inspirational af! I am socializing with fam, friends, and acquaintences during this time. Also trying to exercise consistently, move around, my fav hobbies, and make myself laugh afterwards whenever I have a hard time over these courses. But yes, sleep is also important to keep my sanity. And to not overcaffeinate myself."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,631,"I am currently in Pre-Bio because I haven't finished my lower division classes yet. I am still trying to decide between cell and molecular biology and physiology. I’m conflicted because I know physiology should help prepare me for medical school but cell and molecular biology is interesting because I want to do biomedical research. I am being introduced to a bunch of things so I keep changing and changing but I know for sure I want to do biology. I knew I wanted to major in biology when I was in high school because I was super interested in the body. I was mainly interested in finding cures for diseases – specifically genetic diseases because I was afraid of the diseases that ran in my family. Besides the family diseases, though, I’m just really interested in biology, and chemistry sometimes, and I want to come up with a question in biology that I am interested in to motivate myself even more."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,632,"For a long time I did not know what I wanted to major in. I knew that I wanted to go into the STEM field but I could not set my mind to a specific major. My freshman year, I took an introduction to biology course and it changed my whole perspective. I realized that it was what I wanted to study for the rest of my life. Biology has always been such an intriguing topic. To this very day, there are courses that my major requires that are quite difficult but nonetheless they are interesting. Every specific topic in biology has its own reasoning behind it and story as to how it came about being discovered and I find that fascinating. There are still so many things to be discovered in the world of biology that we talk about in a few of my courses and those mysteries are interesting to hear about."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,625,"In middle school I would always enjoy learning about the human body and about life and how things are the way they are now. But in middle school I wasn't really sure what i wanted to major in or what I wanted to do when I was older. But after taking Biology my freshman year I knew I wanted to get into the stem field and learn more about the human body. I was very interesting to me when we would learn about different viruses, diseases, different parts of our bodies and the different ways we can prevent certain things from killing humans. I soon realized that I wanted to pursue a career in science and major in a STEM field. Additionally, my cousin who also majored in Biology-physiology was giving me an overview of the classes she had taken and even though some of the classes did sound scary I did not want to switch my major/ give up. Ultamilty, being in a stem field will help me with my future career goal as a pediatrician. By becoming a pediatrician I am able to work with kids in the states and also have a chance to work with kids in need in different countries."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,76,"I want to go into the my major because I always wanted to do something, since I was a little kid, in the science field. My mom, most of my aunts, and my sister all work at UCSF and Kaiser which really inspires and motivates me even more to pursue my dream of being a Radiologist. When I first entered SFSU my major was Business, but I realized that I didn’t have an interest in that and it wouldn’t  make me happy if I kept it. I felt more pressured to choose a major before entering college than actually choosing what I wanted because I didn’t want to be undeclared. What made me want to become a Radiologist was my aunt. She told me all the steps I had to take in order to become one and what she did to be successful. She told me that City College of San Francisco is 1 of 3 schools, I believe, that has the 2 year program of Radiology that no other university provides. I know that being in the Science field is not easy and that it takes time and patience to pursue your dreams, but that’s with everything and anything as long as you put your heart and hard work into. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,581,"I want to go into my major because I have always had a passion for science, especially involved in human anatomy. Originally, I wanted to go into the emergency medical technician field, but that was not a reasonable choice for my future. I chose biology with a concentration in physiology because I am interested in the build up of the body and how each part of the body works. The human body is so complex and understanding it takes a lot of practice and desire to learn. I plan on using my major to become a physicians assistant and hopefully work in a small office along side a general physician. My grandpa was a physician and I have always had a great admiration for him and his work. He was very much respected in our family and ultimately, I would like to make him and the rest of my family proud of my work. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,637,"I’ve wanted to major in marine biology since I was about 5 years old. Initially, I wanted to work with orcas in a zoo or aquarium; however this changed when I was about 8, and learned what life was actually like for orcas in captivity. My focus changed to wanting to research marine mammals instead; to learn more about their culture, and ultimately help spread awareness for marine mammals, and the oceans they call home. This has progressed much further over the years; especially when I started volunteering and working at a facility that rescues, rehabilitates and researches marine mammals. At this facility I saw the true impact of humans on the oceans around us, and how detrimental the oceans survival is not only for all the creatures that live within, but for our own survival as a species.  A common phrase I heard at this facility was, “you come for the animals, but you stay for the people;” and I believe this also translates to why I want to continue studying marine biology. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,584,"The reason I wanted to go into my major was to gain a better understanding of what it is I was missing. I originally entered SFSU and finished my political science major and realized why not try a different major. In high school, I found myself to be traumatized by the field of science, and thought that anyone who did well was just naturally gifted, and that any amount of work I put in wasn't going to be enough. I remember my Junior Year of high school I was in AP Biology and I was studying harder than I've ever studied. Writing lab reports that I would give to my brother to check to see if it was done correct;y. because he was in college doing the same thing basically. He thought it was perfect, and every time I went to turn something in, I would never score higher than either a C or a D. And I was like, what is this. It basically killed my nascent love for the science very early. After that, I took an aptitude test and found a new love for dissecting mystery novels. It is then I was drawn towards the field of law. It was interesting,because a lot of what made up law was learning how to think, and how to dissect information which I genuinely loved. And to this day I still love that aspect of the field. Once I finished, I thought I would feel something, like a sense of accomplishment. And to some extent I did, but I also felt like my work was not done. That I was only halfway there. So I decided to take a step back to try and figure out what was going on. It is then I realized, yes I am an individual with an array of talents, and interests. But getting involved in political science didn't really give me what I wanted. In all honesty it felt like a glorified history major. A major hindsight, I really didn't care for. It was okay, but not what I was meant to do. The field of law still interests me, but my real love is people, and the desire to help through surgery. Because that was my original love when I was in high school. The reason I didn't major in a science class was because my first experience was traumatic, my brother and friends were always telling me horror stories about their experiences. In a lot of ways I felt like I was running away because I didn't want to fail.After taking a semester and this being my second semester, I understand the fear, but I don't let it get to me that much. Belief in self is one of the things I had to learn, because most of my life has been filled with anxiety and questioning myself to a very destructive degree. This major is a gateway to my overall goal. Medical School. And I just hope to god I can get there. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,641,"If we are being honest here, the main reason is because it's needed to attend medical school and also it's a backup plan for me. I want to become a doctor, I’m thinking of becoming a trauma surgeon or a pediatrician. I know these two are completely different career choices, but there are reasons why I want to adventure in these two. I am a swim teacher at La Petite Baleen, where I teach kids how to swim and gives me joy doing so; I want to do the same in the medical field and give kids something to smile about.  Basically, the reason why I’m going into this major, which is microbiology, is to be in an open area and not stuck in an office. I can be creative, I can do so in my major either in the lab, out in the field or in a hospital where I’m constantly on call. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,636,Hanan AliWhy do I want to go into my major?I have always enjoyed science classes and have a genuine interest in science topics. I'm chose to pursue a Biology major because I want to learn more about science essentially. I also enjoy labs and watching science come to life. I'm currently a biology major and my coursework builds on the living and non-living organisms and how they survive and contribute to our ecosystem. I've had a natural curiosity and love of biology so I chose it as my major. Even though a  Biology major may be challenging at times it definitely worth the extra effort.The STEM field is always rapidly evolving and advancing each day. So everyone in STEM is constantly learning and developing their skills. The range of STEM field is pretty versatile so you're not as limited in the work field which is a positive factor. Being in the STEM field is my way of giving back to my community in a positive way. I feel that with my skills I’m able to contribute to the STEM field and learn along the way. By following my passion I’m able to hopefully find a career that matches my interests.
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,628,"I want to go into my major because i am very interested about all the biology labs and what they do, how they do it and why since some help find cure or vaccines and some test blood samples, i am not too sure what exactly i want to be but i know that i want to major in either cell and molecular biology or microbiology since they are both very similar. I do not really want to work with people in terms as in how a doctor would with patients but more like behind the scenes in a way but also making a big impact. I also do not certainly want to go to medical school since it does take another couple years to many years to complete, and you do not have to go to medical school to get into cell and molecular biology labs, you can get a job with your bachelors, i also know a friend that has also been to sf state and is also in a bio lab, he used to major in cell and molecular so that will also help me get a better chance of getting in since i can have a refferal"
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,533,"Why I’m in my major     My major is biochemistry and at first I chose this major because I liked both biology, chemistry, and science in general. And so far it’s been good. But when I meet other biochemistry majors they all want to be doctors and honestly I’m not sure that’s what I want. I’m still figuring out careers within my major. What I do like about my major is going to labs and doing experiments, I feel like I would be into research even though I haven’t done research. I enjoy doing long complicated math problems. It feels like puzzles are difficult but works with practice. I think that’s why I’ve started in my major and I’m still a first year so there is sooo much more to learn within my major. So I’m looking forward to it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,643,"The reason that I am a pre-biochemistry major over any other major is that I am applying to medical school someday and I wanted a major that would both prepare me for the medical exam as well as teach me the inner workings of concepts rather than the overview. I did consider taking majoring in biology because I love the subject and I felt like the plan they offered was a lot more focused on what I wanted to get out of undergrad before medical school. As I further compared biochemistry and biology, I realized that I could always take the courses I wanted to as my bio electives later in the year and focus more on learning core concepts. The main reason I want to continue biochemistry is that I feel like it will better prepare me to be the kind of medical professional I want to be. I want to become a gynecologist and further that profession to cover more medical and surgical subfields I can access from that. In the long run, focusing more on biochemistry will better prepare me to focus on biology."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,638,"To even discuss and define my reasons for selecting and committing to my major, I first must explain what my major is and what it entails. My bachelor of science, biology with a focus in physiology, involves the study of how either human or animal anatomical structures function. There are options to focus in either animal or human physiology and I have chosen to study human body functions so far. ""Why?"", might you ask. The answer is simple and yet complex. I am pursuing a career I medicine and patient care. More specifically, I want to attend a program to be nationally licensed as a physician's assistant also known as a PA in the american medical field. PA's are in high demand with great employment opportunities and employment benefits. As you may have guessed from the job title, physician assistants provide professional assistance to doctors in their respective departments in surgery to medication prescriptions. They work under the authority of a leading physician. It is one big team and I ant to be a part of it. The major I chose will prepare me academically.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,634,"I recently switched into requesting Apparel and Design as my major. I chose to switch the major because my classes for my bio major were getting hard for me and I did not feel like I was ready to continue to be in the medical field way. So i decided to switch my major into another field that I would like to explore because growing up, I always enjoyed playing dress up and trying out different styles. On my free time or when I have trouble focusing in classes, I would zone out and end up doodling a lot growing up. I also enjoyed drawing pieces that I like or creations. I started to become more aware of the environmental impact that the fashion industry has had, with is economic advantages with using certain material and labor use, oppose to its negative affects on the environment as well as the workers themselves. I grew up pushing away interests and dreams to fulfill what my parents made me think was the only way to be successful in life, being in the medical field. Although other sciences do interest me, I would like to take this time to explore my creative side in the fashion world. I want to design as well as ensure the use of sustainable fibers and ethical labor."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,629,"As of right now I am taking Chemistry 215, so that I can advance further into the biology.  Right now I am deciding whether or not I want to go into the field of science or in the field of technology.  I would want to go into the biology field because of the careers I would want to pursue in the future.  For example, I would go into  science because I would like to work in the medical field.  I am not really sure about that career yet.  I would want to go into technology, because I really enjoy computers, and might want to go into computer engineering.  This is a dilemma I am facing right now.  I am not really sure which one is the right path for me.  I enjoy both fields so much, however the only I do not like is all the math that is involved for both fields.  I want to go into the Stem field, because of all the job opportunities that that are available.  Not to mention that there are many high paying long term jobs for people in the stem field. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,635,"My major is biochemistry, I had no idea what I was getting into and even till now I’m still contemplating this decision. I knew I wanted to be part of the medical field, and I knew I wanted to be a part of science and I knew I wanted to help people. The problem was narrowing down to what exactly I wanted to do as a career. At first it was pharmacy, then nursing, then lab work with blood, then lab work with drugs, and now a whole doctor. It's getting hard when I’m reaching the point where I can’t switch out of my major. Those occupations I mentioned do match up with biochemistry but I feel like I’m not confident with it. I see other majors like general biology in physiology or chemistry makes sense because they are tailored to exactly what they are. Biochemistry is like a mix and that's the reason why I went in, it was a combination of biology and chemistry. I went into this major thinking that maybe I would have a clear idea of what I want to do with the medical field and the truth is that I’m still narrowing it down. It’s giving me opportunities and I yet to see what I like. For whatever I land on I hope I’m happy with it, having fun and helping those who need it the most. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,574,"Angela O. SanchezOne of the reasons why I want to go into my major is because I love chemistry but at the same time, I love biology and I wanted both of two worlds combined. I went into my major during my sophomore year of college, the reason for that is because I fell in love with chemistry but I didn’t realized how much I loved it until I took my first chemistry class in college,. I had taken AP chemistry in high school and I had completely forgotten that I loved chemistry since I took it in my freshman year of high school. Nevertheless, biochemistry will help better understand about the human body and since I want to become a doctor, I know that I cannot go wrong with biochemistry. I also believe that one of the reasons why I love biochemistry is because it’s hard and since it forces me to better assist what I am learning, I am willing to work hard and to better understand the material. Of course, I have not yet fully understood the basics of biology but this summer I will, and I am excited to further my education. I am ready now; I wasn’t about three years ago but I am now."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,642,"the reason I choose my major which is biology with a concentration in physiology because I want to become a pharmacist as my career. When I first entered, SFSU I was a psychology, then biochemistry major. But one or two semesters, I met this person that told me you don't need such a hard major to become a pharmacist. I can do pharmacy with a biology major with a concentration in physiology. I looked it up and it says that pharmacy would be a good career with this major. And a plus is that it takes way less units to graduate than a biochemistry degree. But I don't think I am going to graduate on time because there is so many classes to take but not enough time to complete. Hopefully I find a way to work it out. I am also minoring in chemistry because I am already taking chemistry classes that are needed for the chemistry minor which is a plus. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,626,"Why I want to become a zoologist is because I always had animals in my heart as a kid. Watching documentaries about animals motivated me to major in zoology. Looking at it now, I am glad I am going in this major because so much is happening to animals that they are becoming extinct or endangered. I want to help animals feel as there is no one in the world harming them. Meaning researching on different diseases that are causing harm to their species. Even trying to find solutions to help their habitat be protected from human activity. I just want to help them enjoy their lives without any disruption in their population. Hopefully, when I finish school I would be able to make a change for animals in the wild. I also want to bring awareness to people who don't know the issues that revolve around animals. People should be able to get a sense that their daily lives can make a change if they know the issues with human activity that can cause damage to any species of animals. That is why I want to major in zoology."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,627,"After I graduate from SFSU, I want to go to medical school and earn an MD and possibly go into dermatology or plastic surgery. I want to get into research so maybe I might change my mind and want to pursue a career in research. Or possibly get a combined MD-PHD. Either way I want to get into the medical field and one day have my own practice ideally. This is the reason why I picked my major. I was a general biology major but after looking at the more specialized classes for physiology, I chose to switch to biology with a concentration in physiology. I found the option of classes super interesting and I have my future goals of going to medical school. But I also chose to go in my specific major because I love biology and enjoy learning about it."
