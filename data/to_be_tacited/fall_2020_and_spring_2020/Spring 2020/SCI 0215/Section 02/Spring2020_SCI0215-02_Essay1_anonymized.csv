Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,625,"I signed up for this SCI class to get additional help in Chemistry. After taking chem 115 I learned a lot of information but I realized that Chem 215 was going to be a little more challenging. Before chem 115 the last time I took chemistry was my sophomore year in highschool, and as a sophomore in college currently, most of the material that I had went over in highschool I had forgotten. But because I took chem last semester most of the material is still fresh.  I also like how it is once a week so I was able to fit the class in my schedule. Additionally, this is my second year taking a Sci class. My first year of taking Sci, I really enjoyed it. In addition, this will be very beneficial to me because I would gain better study habits, get better review sheets, and more practice worksheets. Those worksheets would help me prepare me for future exams and have a better understanding of what we go through in class. When I was preparing for the first exam I was able to ask my SCI instructors for help and the material that was given to us really helped me understand the general concept. Lastly, taking a one unit course would boost my gpa so that was another benefit as to why I decided to take this course."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,626,"The reason why I am here, and more focusing on the specific class is because I need the extra help in chemistry. I am usually a shy person, so being able to speak to others in the class brings me out of my shell. I know the reason why everyone is in the class because they have similar reasons like I do; being able to connect with one another and build more information together. It gives me a confidence boost within myself to explore more, and try to make more friends. I realized the more people you know the extra help you can get with the sections I am struggling with, because someone is bound to know that topic by the heart or know a different way to explain. Getting different opinions and ideas is always helpful to me. I like to know how there is so many different roads to take for a certain topic by just speaking to others. I am able to build off more on their ideas, or even come up with my own way by taking different ways on how to study/take notes for class. That is why I have been taking many SCI classes is because it gives me an opportunity to learn by others and make friends with different people."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,627,I am taking this SCI class to give myself more practice so i’ll be more prepared for exams and the material in general in class. I have class during my professor’s office hours and I tend to suffer in silence and try to figure it out myself when I’m confused about topics. This is my first time taking a SCI class so I’m happy to get the extra help and get a boost to my GPA. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,628,I am in this SCIENCE 215 because I really need to have a deeper understanding of the chemistry class and the material that is taught. I am here so the material I have learned to have a understanding by going over a lot of example questions and going over practice exams that have helped me in the previous SCI classes. The practice exams are really helpful Because they are back check by the two chemistry teachers teaching style/testing style. We go recap on a lot of material so i can really get what i going on by all the example problems they give us and seeing why and how to work together to really understand the material rather than just knowing the information from a short class period. The practice problems help us with understanding since it is a lot more interacting and involving than lecture. We go step by step and explanations why it is the way it is.
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,581,"Frankly, I am here because I need help in this class and I want to be successful in my classes. This semester is much more stressful than last semester, so I need these SCI classes in order to help me understand the material and be able to utilize what I learn. Because these are all lower division classes, I am holding myself to a higher standard and I want to increase my knowledge. SCI usually gives me tips, tricks, and a lot of practice for what I need to know to succeed. I’m in SCI because I need the tools to help me graduate and do my very best. School is hard enough as it is, but having SCI is something that we cannot take for granted as we only have so many classes they are available for. I am here because I want to do well and move on into my career path with confidence."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,629,"I am at San Francisco State University, because I heard about the great biology program here and it is not that far from home.  San Francisco State University is also located in one of the greatest cities, so it was a pretty easy decision to come to school here.  I am studying in the field of biology, because I have always been interested in science, especially biology.  Biology has always been interesting to me, because of how it can explain many things I do not know about living things.  In the future I want to either get into the medical field or get into law, that is another reason why I am in biology.  If I do not end up going into the medical field or getting into law, I would most likely want to become a professor, or work in a lab.  I am in chem 215, because it is required for me to continue my biology education.  I am in the sci class for chemistry, because I feel like it will help my understanding of the chemistry concepts.  Also, I believe the sci class for chem 215 will possibly help me form new study groups, so that I can efficiently study the material at hand. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,630,"Lubat AsadovaFebruary 21, 2020Reflective Journal #1 I enrolled in SCI 220 for multiple reasons. Firstly, science is my passion because of that I want to study each course like physics, biology, and chemistry in depth. I believe, the SCI class provides the details that give depth to the physics concept. Peer learning is an effective way to expose the complicated concepts. Secondly, this class is effective in terms of covering material and time. I spend studying for Physics around two hours per week which slightly less in the SCI. Therefore, I study efficiently in the groups and get extra credit while attending those classes. Finally, after the last semester SCI 220, I found it to be super fun. We play games and teach each other. This type of study reinforces learning in the long term by retrieval practice. I decided to take SCI 215.  After all, hearing the statistics of 80% of SCI students pass the parental class motivates me to part of SCI 220. Something, I hope to master the study and learning skills, problem-solving skills and to expose myself to new ones as I am planning to pursue in academia and in the career"
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,631,"To be specific about this class, I am here because it is a requirement for my major. In a general sense, I am here at school because I chose to have a career in STEM, specifically biomedical science, which also requires me to go to school. I chose this career because I have always wanted to do research. Since I was a kid, I've always been curious about many things especially the body. I had many family members pass away before me due to multiple illness and diseases. I'd often ask why they had that disease or what affects does it have on people. I wanted to help figure things out because I felt that it was important to ensure that no one comes across these illnesses that have killed many of my family members. Another reason why I found it important for me to be in STEM is because I want to be a role model for other children of color. No one in my family had either went to college or had pursued a degree in STEM. I want to show other children of color that they can be apart of STEM and they can contribute significantly to research. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,632,"I am here because I want to do something with my life. The way that I was brought up, my parents have always told me if not school then what is the key to success? Being in school is my start towards success. I am a biology physiology major and I have high hopes to get a career in the medical field. As of right now I want to be a physician's assistant but I have yet to do further research towards other careers and specialties. Once I graduate my undergraduate program I plan on working towards getting hands on medical work which I can then use when applying to medical field jobs. I am specifically here in this class because I want to succeed in general chemistry 215. This sci course gives me additional resources that I can use to help ,e study and do well in the course."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,584,"Why Am I HereI am here to gain the skills I need to pass the Physics portion of the MCAT and enter Medical School. My goal is to become a surgeon, either Cardio or General Surgery. The reason I desire to go to Medical School is because I feel that it is what I meant to do. It is apart of my identity, and it allows me to connect with a piece the piece of humanity I thought I had once lost. In a lot of ways, I guess, my intentions for wanting to become a surgeon are a little selfish. I desire to help others, because in a way it helps me become a better person. To grow, to feel, to care, be apart of something that is far bigger than myself. Taking this course is a first step to understanding the intricacies of the world we live in, which will help me grow as an individual. I just hope I can pull it off. I also want to get a better educations, get a better job, preferably one with advancement opportunities. I also want a job that I love, and this is a first step in that particular direction. When I do apply for medical school, I also plan to earn an associate’s degree in surgical technology, so that even if I don’t get in, I’ll have something to fall back on, and add to my application for when I reapply."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,633,"In my parents perspective im here to better my education and to gain a well paid career and profession, in their eyes im here to make them proud and to be their successor of sorts......for me on the other hand im here to try to persue my dreams of working with exotic animals that I had as a child but to be completely honest now that im here working towards my degree and career path I feel lost, some days I wake up with a good mind set and ""get it done"" mind set but as the day continues with classes and school I get defeated and I'm not sure if its because I get overwhelmed with school and the material of my classes or if it is just me overthinking and overreacting over my responsibilities that my classes give me as well as just trying to live in society, handling two jobs, a relationship, bills....lots of bills, and money. somedays I feel like my reason for being here at school specifically is blurred from me....other days I feel like the reason for me being here is based on the expectations of other people especially my parents and family and people who look up to me and who believe in me and depend on me to make something out of myself. I'm not sure if this response answers the question but to be real I have been trying to answer that question within me for a while now and all I can say is that I still searching for that answer.....but I'm not sur if I'll ever truly find it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,634,"I am not sure what this question specifies about so I will talk about general places where I am at. In terms of existing, I am here because I am searching to find my purpose in life to fulfill as well as to enjoy my time being, to experience and to do something that makes me happy. In terms of being in San Francisco State, I am here because I was accepted here and it is located in San Francisco which called to me when I was in high school. I wanted to try to grow on my own away from home and my family. In terms of this class, I am here because I am taking Chem 215 and was afraid it might be too challenging as I ended Chem 115 with a C, so I would very much like to improve that grade. However, currently I am feeling a bit lost with myself to be able to genuinely answer this question to be satisfied. In other terms, I am feeling unsure about my current position- being a bio major, going to school here. However I am glad to be here in the city of San Francisco because I believe there are many exciting things to do here."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,635,"When enrolling in classes for the spring semester I knew exactly what I needed to take but I didn’t consider the amount of credits that I was taking. Once I had signed up to all the right classes I only needed a couple more to get a full enrollment status. Having that full enrollment status is important to me because I need the full financial support. Money is hard to come by for me, I don’t have a job and I’m chewing away from my family’s money, I feel guilty every time I ask from them. I only had 10 or so credits so I needed one more class. I didn’t want another lecture like class and some of those lecture classes conflicted with my schedule. I asked around my study group at the time what classes should I take, they suggested a try sci class to complement my General Chemistry 2 class. I haven’t taken a chemistry class since last summer at my local community college. I barely remember much as a majority of the the contents and topics taught were brief. From what I’m told, sci was an additional class student could take to, improve gpa, gain additional help, and gain extra credits. With having all those benefits I had to sign up. Right now I feel it was a good decision, helped me understand new topics and more problems to practice with. I only hope that this class will continue to help me with chem this semester and maybe give me something I haven’t learned in the past."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,574,"Angela Orellana -SanchezI am here because I want to get better at my chemistry, I want to start understanding it more verses just knowing how to make it and just getting the grade. After all my major is Biochemistry and if I can not understand the simple foundations of it then I how can I overcome the most difficult parts of chemistry. I want to understand the equilibrium , reactions, and products... when it shifts to the right, when it shifts to the left.  Also after my quiz on chemistry 216, I realized that I have to practice more and more and I am lacking in the stichometry when I shouldn't have been lacking at all. This weekend I plan to start reading the book and taking down notes . I also would like to be more Aleks if it will help me and that way I can stay knowing the foundation. Honestly the Kahoot really put me in bad spirits but also put me in hopes because now I know what I need to learn. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,636,"Hanan Ali February 21,2020Why am I here?I am here to try my best and participate in the learning processes. I want to achieve better grades by receiving additional support in chemistry. I’m here to practice my skills and learn how to share my ideas in a group setting. I also want to learn from my peers and instructors on how to approach chemistry. would also like to challenge myself as a student.Ideally, I am here to graduate and pursue a career in the science field. I feel like I want to grow as a college student add to my current understanding of chemistry.I also feel that SCI is a great place to make mistakes and understand the learning process.  I am here to be a productive individual and add to my learning experience at San Francisco State University. Overall, I’m here to focus on my future and have a positive influence on society."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,541,"The reasons as to why I’m here is because as a child my goal was to always pursue higher education and make my parents proud. As a first-generation college student it was really hard for me to get here. My first year of college I struggled a lot. I had no idea that the state offered SCI courses and I didn't take advantage of it. My second year at state was when I took advantage of these sci courses because I knew that they would help succeed. As a bio major these science courses have been really tough, the two sci classes that I’ve taken so far have been SCI 215, and SCI 240. Both of these classes helped me through my classes. I signed up for this class because chemistry is really tough subject for me to understand and last semester in my SCI class I made friends that helped me study when I need help, "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,637,"I am here because it has been some time since I have taken Chem 115, and this has made me very nervous about taking Chem 215. I am hoping by taking this Sci class I will give myself more opportunities to study, and work out the things that I may be unsure about. It is not always easy to meet with a professor or to meet people to study with. By having a slightly more formal setting where there are others participating, I hope to have more confidence to ask my own questions. And also to see that I am not alone in my confusion over some of the things we are learning. Lastly, I have a lot of anxiety around exams, and seeing what really got to me during the mock exam really helped focus me a bit more for the actual test. Even though I know I made mistakes, I was able to answer every question on the test, and didn’t completely panic. I hope that this class will continue to help prepare me for more moments like those."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,638,I am here at San Francisco State University because I want to learn in an environment different from where I have grown up. I have recently declared my major in Biology with the Physiology concentration. I am excited to keep learning in this academic journey of mine. I partially describe myself as a scholar and I feel the most scholastic taking part in the scientific activities. I am physiology to prepare for my inevitable application to California physician assistant programs. Physician Assistance is a very desirable job in the medical field and patient care has been an interest of mine for a long time. I am in this supplemental science course as form of extra preparation for mt upcoming exams for the next three months. Medicine is a deep career interest of mine ever since my early years in middle school. The thought of having ill people looking to me for guidance compelled me to keep focused on the relevant course because I feel medical treatment is satisfying form of affection and care a human can give to another. This is why I am here at this school and in this class.
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,533,"I am here taking this SI class because I'm afraid of not passing my chemistry class. I'm afraid of asking for help. I don't want to hate a subject because I'm too slow of a learner. I'm taking SI because it helps me not be afraid. I've taken SI before and I went into it just thinking about a study group type of class, and it kinda is like that but I've discovered it's more than just studying. You meet great instructors that are positive and want everyone to learn and have a good grip on the concept in order to be confident when taking a quiz or exam. SI class provides help and support. I’m here to pass chemistry 215 with an A, just like I did last year with the help of SI."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,639,"I am here at San Francisco State University as an undergrad student because it was always a dream for me to go to a 4 year college right after high school and because education is really important to me due to what my parents have instilled in me as a child which is that knowledge is power. I am in this specific class because I am determined to get a good grade in my Chem 215 class since it is a requirement of my major of Biology with a Concentration of Physiology. I am here because I commute to school everyday from Antioch, CA to further my education. I am in school because I want to be successful and one day become an ultrasound technician because it is my dream occupation since I was in middle school. When I was small I wanted to know how children were born and as I got older I thought ultrasound was very interesting and could be fun not only that but what better job then to tell people the gender of their baby, which is one of the best news you could give someone!!"
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,76,"I am here because I want to succeed in Chem 215. I have taken Sci classes before for Bio 230 and 240 and they really helped me, especially when preparing for exams. I try to take a sci class every semester because I have trouble focusing and understanding the professor since it is more fast paced and the class is big so it’s hard to have that one on one. I am here because I want to broaden my understanding of the concepts we learn in class and be able to solve the equations without having any trouble. I am not the best in math and I have always had trouble problem solving, because most of the time I second guess and confuse myself which makes me do bad when it comes to exams. So, with the help of my sci professors and classmates I hope I am able to pass this class. "

The amount of support and peeps I've met up until this point, have given me purpose to keep continuing through. I've yet to fully bring out my potential up until this point, but there's some small accomplishments/ progress. I was never the ""straight A"" student that people percieve me to be.... but more of someone that has been through many trials-and-errors, mistakes, and failures to be a competent learner in school. I want to extensively live my life where I can place my own ""legacy"" in life. I want to fill people around me with positive memories, love, knowledge, and teachable moments. I want to give inspiring life stories to my future generational family members. I want the people whom I care about around me to feel my gentle compassion in many different ways... that, is how I want people to remember me by.... someone whose able to smile, and remain positive through everything she's faced."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,641,"The reason why I'm here is because I want to get a good grade on this class. I truly want an A and the only way I can do that is being on top of work and getting help from people or anyway possible. I really thought that a SCI class wasn't really worth my time, but it actually is. It was a big before the exam, going through some mock exams and asking any questions for certain questions that I didn't understand or that the whole class did not understand at all. It's great that I'm not the only person in that class that needs help, I do have my friends in that class. We can help each after SCI class, sometimes we don't get to sit with one another during in class but that's okay. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,642,"I am here taking this Sci 215 class because I am trying to be able to understand the concepts that we are learning during lecture. I have taken Sci 115 last semester and I felt that it has really helped me throughout the 115 class, so I am thinking that this Sci class I could help me with this class. Sci classes I feel like are the best class to take to be able to understand more in depth on concepts. I really hope I passed my chem 215 test.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,643,"When asked the question, ""Why am I here?"", I immediately think about my degree. My main goal is to learn. I am majoring in biochemistry and this is one of the classes I must take, however, it is only one step to aid my plans in the future. My goals in life are to become an ob-gyn and open my own clinic. I want to provide people with healthcare that will leave them feeling safe and informed. I’ve had a lot of friends who have gone through something related to gynecology and felt uninformed and confused while talking to their doctors. I want to be the solution. The pre-med route sounds really scary but I believe in myself and that I will get there to pursue my goals and fulfill my purpose. My main purpose is to help. Whether it is my friends or family, even people I just met, helping them is something I stand by. Being able to lift as many worries off of people is something that I find joy in. Whenever I am free I dedicate my time to others and that is why I am here."
