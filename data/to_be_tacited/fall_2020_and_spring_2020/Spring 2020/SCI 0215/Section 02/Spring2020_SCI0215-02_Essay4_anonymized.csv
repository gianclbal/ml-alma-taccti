2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,637,"For me, the times when I find myself most interested in what we are learning is when the information is related back to people. Our bodies are chemistry in action, whether that is the everyday on-goings of our internal systems or what we can create on the outside to learn more about the inside systems; which could lead to bettering ourselves. The most recent topic of Ksp, also known as the solubility product constant, didn’t seem like it would be anything too great, but if related back to the body it got a little more interesting. Since the Ksp is the solubility constant of a compound, how can knowing a Ksp of some compound, benefit us as humans? If a Ksp is less than one, it will be sparingly soluble. This is helpful in the medical field, in that compounds that have a low Ksp, and are non-toxic can be used in the human body for running imaging tests. When these compounds are ingested very little of the compound will dissolve when digested, this can create a more defined image. An example of a compound with a low Ksp used for this type of test is barium sulfate. Imaging tests like this, can aid in diagnosing Crohn's disease, and many other conditions.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,630,"As a freshman, this was the first chem sci class that I took in the college, setting up my confidence and impression. I enjoyed not only the curriculum but most importantly my peers and my facilitators. The course boosted my interest in science. I am anticipating to perform many chemistry through my study and carrer. Chemistry is important as science because often it is hard for people to imagine how theoretical concepts or how the material learned in the classroom setting apply to scientific inquiry or real life. This is a problem because I want to learn and study to apply my knowledge to work in life or in my career.for example in chem class we talked a lot about the acid base. NOt only it can neutralize to form water it can also form buffers. Buffer solutions are used as a means of keeping pH at a nearly constant value in a wide variety of chemical applications. In nature, there are many systems that use buffering for pH regulation. The desired buffer can be calculated using diffrent ways with specific properties necessary. Also by knowing how acid or bases behaives, we can understand what acid or base should be used for example to ake a dresing for the salad which is the best cleaning option. Example in us, the bicarbonate buffering system is used to regulate the pH of blood.The class was incredible investment of time. It was also where I developed a strong network of supporters through lab."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,642,"A topic that was covered in my last class was finding the molarity in mixed solutions. For this, I guess this is applicable in someones life if they are in a research lab trying to find out the different molarities to use during their experiment. Another way is if you are teaching chemistry to students. Teachers would show students the path of how to find the different molarity and students will get to learn and understand that concept like how we are doing in this class right now! For me, this topic is relevant because during my chemistry lab, our professor would always ask us to have the calculations ready before coming to lab. So learning how to find the different molarities has helped me be able to do my lab report. So what I am basically saying is that if you are a chemistry researcher in the lab, a teacher that teaches chemistry or a student that learns chemistry, then this is relevant.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,581,"The topic I want to cover is the idea of rate law. The question being, “why is rate law so important to an experiment and equation”? Ultimately, we know that the rate law finds the rate determining step. “According to the law of mass action, the rate of a chemical reaction at a constant temperature depends only on the concentrations of the substances that influence the rate. The substances that influence the rate of reaction are usually one or more of the reactants, but can occasionally include products” (chem.libretext.org). The determining step is the step in the experimental procedure that can determine how fast or slow the reaction can proceed (or possibly even stop). This also helps us find what chemical is the determinate. Granted, this all only happens when there is a set temperature. Temperature will change the outcome, usually with a higher temperature pushing the experiment to speed up whereas cooler temperatures will slow the process of the experiment. Of course, there are other factors that can relate to the rate law pushing the experiment faster or slower. If there is a catalyst in the reaction, it will lead to the experiment speeding up rather than slowing down or stopping."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,640,"As much as I dread Chemistry, I think it's applicable to life with the skills used to solve problems in this course, such as critical thinking, gathering information to determine which calculations are needed to use. In real life, we use stochiometry to convert into measurable quantities... like cooking or measure prices with the amount being bought/sold..... this week I was able to determine how much I saved getting a travel size of perfume vs. buying the normal size of perfume.When thinking about the human body, there is a complex function that can be picked out by learning about chemistry, biology, and other biological sciences. Our body runs in moderate homeostasis within set temperatures, pH, and in a microbiological level...... psychological reactions from chemicals made within our bodies can be applied through what we learn from chemistry. This semester, we've learned about acid/basic reactions, pH changes, and affect of temperature changes to cause different reactions...But relating back to my education goals and field of major, I am surprised how much different science courses can weave in between other science courses, like Physics, Genetics, or Biological Sciences. There were theories and ideas that tie back eventually with what I'm learning."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,635,"In lecture we went over the equilibrium of compounds and their solubility with relations to Ksp. The question is how to calculate the solubility of an ionic compound when a common ion is present. First we must know what compounds are going in what. For the sake of convenience we are going to use water and 0.0120 m of Na2CrO4 and we are trying to find the solubility of PbCrO4. To begin we are going to find solubility in water. First we create an ICE  table based on the reaction with water, and with our final equilibria we should have a value of x^2 since there are no moles being added or subtracted. Ksp is equal to the equilibrium so we then square it. The ksp value is the solution diluted at a certain temperature which is given or can be found. From the square root of the ksp you then multiply it by the molar mass of the PbCrO4. The result is the amount of solution in moles that is diluted in water. The same process is made with the Na2Cro4 with the exception of the stoichiometry and molarity of 0.012 m that it has. In a way you already know the value at which the solution can be diluted but here we are solving for what effects it has in different substances. In the real world this can be used to find how chemicals retain their reaction in a solution until it disappears, and find how much of the substance is used up."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,643,"For this journal entry, I decided to research how titrations could be relevant in medicine. Titration is the process or technique used to ascertain the concentration of a substance in a solution. The titration involves a known reagent being added to the solution of unknown concentration to accomplish this. When applied to real-world applications, titrations are heavily used in different industries depending on their chemical needs. Titrations are a fundamental tool in the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Regarding the medical industry, as stated in my question, titrations can be used to discover the correct dosage of anesthetic for patients undergoing surgical or other invasive medical procedures. Doctors employ titrations to achieve the correct mixture of medications to intravenously treat patients. Titrations can also be used to control blood sugar levels for diabetic patients and other examinations requiring urinalysis. Pharmaceutically, titrations can be used to obtain the correct mix of similar drugs when synthesizing a singular compound. There are several other applications for titrations in pharmaceuticals such as purity analysis, content analysis, precipitation titrations, and pH-stat titrations. These applications can be used primarily in drug testing and formulating to make sure drugs and viable before consumer consumption. This ensures quality control and drug safety when regulating dosages and packaged quantity."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,626,"What we have been learning in class towards the end until the exam is titration between acid and base. One question that I had was how you would sketch the graph of the titration curve? The way to be able to create the curve is first to find the volume of the titrant added into the base solution. Be able to calculate how much is being added. The thing you also have to do is look at the pH while adding acid into the base. Thus that will give an idea of what x and y values to input. In this case, the x-value would be the volume of titrant added and the y-value would be the pH level when adding volume. This will be beneficial to society because we are learning how chemicals work. It would be able to show us how much acid or base to make a solution that is used for everyday usage. If we add too much of something it can be harmful to use in everyday lives. The reason know what to mix with is extremely important because it's very hazardous. You see how many people mix cleaning supplies with not the right amount or even not knowing what they are mixing with. An example can be bleach which is a harsh chemical if not used correctly. Usually, a small amount can go a long way when cleaning that is why we should be careful what we mix bleach with. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,76,"A topic that we covered in lecture class was about Titrations. The question is why are titrations important and what are the real life uses of titration? Titrations are important because they allow us to determine the concentration of a substance with something known reactant with it. It can also be used to determine the concentration of solids by dissolving it to create a solution. One way that we use titration in real life is in medicines. For example, pharmacists use it to get the proper mix for medicines. Such as, making sure to use the right amount of anesthesia during surgery, so it’s not too much or too little. Titration is also used in food and nutrition life for specific diets. It defines the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids of foods and the type of chain length. Short chain and medium chain fatty acids are used as energy where the fatty acids are stored. In the long chains, the bloodstream absorbs the fatty acids where it is stored in cells throughout the body. Titration can also determine salt and sugar concentration levels. One last example is how the use of titration allows to test the right pH levels in aquarium water in order for the fish to survive. It’s really interesting learning about all these topics in Chemistry and in other classes in general, because we don’t notice how much all these things relate to real life. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,631,"One thing that I found important in class that is relevant to society is pH. pH is very important because there are many things in our bodies and in our lives that are able to work at specific pH levels. For example, our stomach acid is able to work at a pH of 1.5-3.5. When we get sick it could be because our pH balance is off in whatever area. We also see that pH is important for plants as soil can have different measurements of pH. Lots of different plants require different kinds of pH. One important thing that we learned about is buffers. Buffers allow biological systems to maintain a specific pH. Our blood used buffers so that the pH stays the same consistently. Buffering is what allows our bodies to have homeostasis. With out buffers, our bodies would keep changing pH and we would continue to be sick since there is no balance. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,629,"What are buffers and titrations? A buffer absorbs free H+ (or OH-) from acids (or bases) that are added to it. This provides a buffer against changes in the pH of the solution. You can think of a buffer solution as a burly tough guy that won't budge when someone tries to push him around. He's sort of like a bouncer at a party. A buffer solution won't budge much from its pH even when we add in an acid or base. A titration consists of adding amounts of a base to an acid and vice versa in order to determine properties of the acid or base making up the solution like concentration and pKa.  Buffers are beneficial in the real world because it is used to keep the bloodstream at a 7.4 pH level. Buffers are also used in shampoos to balance out the alkalinity that would usually burn your scalp.  Titrations are used in the real world in pharmacy and it is also used by doctors.  For example, doctors use titration to ensure they give patients the proper concentration of anesthetics before performing major surgeries. It is also used to measure glucose levels in the blood for those with diabetes."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,633,"Why is it important to have your lab equipment/lab area clean an sanitized before and after labs?I wouldn't really count this as a concept in chem 215 but with the current state of the world right now this idea popped into my head. I believe it is important to keep your lab area clean before and after each lab to reduce the risk of cross contamination between lab procedures and experiments to produce accurate data within each lab experiment. I also believe it is important to have a clean area because that can also help reduce the spread of germs and bacteria from reaching other people within your lab. This helps everyone who is in the lab by not only keeping instruments in the lab clean but also keeps everyone healthy from getting sick, just like our current state in society practicing proper sanitation procedures will keep everyone healthy in the long run and also help with your lab experiments to run smoothly and keep you healthy and safe from harmful chemicals that you use within your lab.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,632,"Looking back at the material that has been covered throughout the last couple of weeks and even throughout the entire semester, I can see how it relates to my life in a broad spectrum. When learning the topics that we have reviewed I really have to be attentive and connect the dots in terms of piecing information together in order to learn certain concepts. I also do this with other things in my life such as things that are big such as mapping out what I want to do as a career or small things such as what I want to eat or how to cook a certain meal. Something in particular that I learned recently that I find relates to my life outside of chemistry 215 is the ice tables. I can use this topic in future chemistry classes as well as in my chemistry 216 lab class. Overall, this class requires me to stay focused and set aside time to plan out good study skills as well as time management and these are also skills that I can use for my other courses and in life in general. This can also be beneficial to others as well, it really depends how each and every individual sees the overall concept of this course."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,636,"Hanan Ali April 24,2020                                                    Reflection 4 Select a concept that was covered in class in the past few weeks, either in lecture or lab, and formulate a question. Then look through your class notes, lab notes, and/or textbook and write an essay in response to your question, summarizing the relevant information. Discuss how this information might be generally applicable to people’s lives and/or how this information might be used to benefit society. Be sure to include some concrete information that was covered this semester, explaining why this specific information is relevant. Be sure to give examples. How to find the pH of a solution? pH is very important concept that we covered in lab and  lecture.Its important to determine the pH of solution.pH is used to measure the Hydrogen ion concentration to measure the alkalinity or acidity of a solution .A neutral solution has a pH of 7.The pH scale is measured between 1-14.The more Hydrogen ion in a solution the more acidic a solution and the lower the pH.Water is has a pH of about 7 which is neutral. Understanding pH is very important and it gives you an understanding of how alkaline or acidic a solution.To calculate pH you can use this equation pH=-log[H3O+].You can manipulate the equation to discover the pH of a solution.pH can be used to monitor an individuals diet and make sure their body is a health well balanced pH.The type of food and how the effect the body a more alkaline body pH is more healthy."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,574,"In the last couple of days I have learned about buffers and pH concentrations. I learned that buffer solutions are  important because buffer is a solution that can withhold  acid or base from multiplying and adding up more. This is done so that it stays neutralized if and when acid or base are added and by doing this we are able to maintain the pH stabilized. This is extremely important because there are other reactions that will be needing stable pH's. So why is chemistry buffering important in our everyday lives well because since buffer is a chemical solution that helps maintain pH to be stabilized, as I have mentioned before, it is important because in living systems it is needed for homeostasis. In general I have had the most fun doing buffering questions but I have also had the most hardest time to understand it as well. But with more practice I know I can fully understand what it is I can fully work on and begin to do well with the buffering questions. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,625,"Why is understanding acid strength/ ph relevant today? With the experiments that we did in the lab about acidity and what we have learned in lecture, acidity is very important because knowing how to solve for acidity can help identify which item is more acidic to the other. For example a fruit is a good way to identify which has more acidity. Lemon is more acidic than water by identifying its ph, in lemon the ph falls between 2 and 3 so that shows that the acidity levels are higher than water. This information might help people's lives because some people want to reduce acidity( acid reflux) in their body. Symptom of acid reflux would be heartburn.  By knowing which foods contain more acidity can help an individual avoid eating that certain food. Additionally it can help others neutralize their intake in acid because having too much acid in your stomach can lead to consequences. Ultimately, it is important that our body has a good ph ratio. To have a good balanced pH ratio, it is important to eat healthier food and make sure that your body is healthy. For example, exercising, maintaining food intake, drinking water, etc are all good ways to help. If your pH is unbalanced that is because there might be too much acidic intake.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,584,"The concept that I have chose i how to calculate the pH of a substance when given either a Concentration (M) or a random pH. And what is the difference between pH and pOH. And how to calculate the when given either value. What are the characteristics of an acid vs a base?When calculating the pH of a substance, you have to first determine what you are given. If you are given a concentration then you would simply input into your calculator -log of that particular given concentration and then voila you have the pH of a particular substance when given a specific concentration. Now if you wanted to know the concentration of a substance and you were given the pH, you would simply take that pH and make it a negative and input it into your calculator as an exponent over ten. That will give you the concentration of of a substance when given only the pH. The difference between pH and pOH is that pH deals with the acidity of a substance called an acid, and pOH deals with the acidity of a substance that is basic. Now if you were given a pH and wanted to find the pOH you would just subtract that pH by 14. Now if you were given concentration then you could just convert that into a pH and subtract by 14, or take  1E-14 and divide it by the given concentration. And then finally do the negative log of that concentration to find the pH.  The characteristics of a an acid is a sour taste, positively charged ions, and for a base there’s a bitter taste, and slipper feeling. Now over the characteristics of an acid and base can benefit society greatly, for example, acids have been used as disinfectants, as material to clean, or even great electricity. Bases have been used to help create soap, with is the foundations for so many different applications like sterilization, understanding the difference between intermolecular forces between different liquids which helped us understand how our bodies function. For example, our cells have a lipid bilayer which id hydrophobic, similar to basic soap. However soap has the property to emulsify fats, which gives us a greater understanding of how our bodies break down fatty chains. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,627,"What is the temperature of the reaction (it is no longer spontaneous)?N2(g) + 3H2(g) -> <- 2H3(g)DeltaS = -197 J/k   DeltaH = -92 KJFor this problem we use an equation derived from deltaG = 0 = deltaH - TdeltaS. From this equation we get T = deltaH/deltaS. From the given DeltaS and DeltaH we get T = -92 KJ/-0.197 KJ/K. Therefore, T = 467 K or 194 degrees celsius."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,641,"A concept that we went over through class was buffers. This one was quite dear to my heart, mostly because this was one of our last in-class labs. My question about buffers is “ What was your last lab/ lecture, before Covid-19 and what role does this play in your way of learning?” As mentioned before, my last lab/ lecture was on buffers. It was towards more of the introduction of buffers in both classes. However, the lab was a bit ahead then the lecture itself, from what I recall. Well, buffer is what it says in its name which it focuses on buffering or resisting pH. Either by using a weak base with its salt or a weak acid with its salt. When it came to lab, we experience this ourselves with experiment #3, where we focused on acid-base equilibrium. We saw this occur when we graphed our results and what we found that there was a constant increase from the recording. Meaning that the buffer was active during that time of our experiment due to the weak solution we added during the titration to let this occur. This was fun doing in-person, but now things are different when going through a lab over a video call. Quite stressful also because we don’t have a clear idea how to do future labs by just looking through videos. I’m not only just a visual learner, but I do learn from actually doing the activity itself."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,2,638,"Science is a timeless method and it is practiced through all areas of focus, from biology to chemistry.The career field I am chasing is medical and more specifically, patient care. I am fascinated how the human body works and the ailments that can come from failure in it's function. In terms everyday life though, I cannot see much application. Also I feel I should explain that I am not necessarily learning in class, but just practicing problems or answering them. Chemistry is such an interesting area of study because it is very conceptual and very mathematical at the same time. One thing I can think of that actually is applicable is if you were to take an acidity indicator dye, add it to water, you can test which brand names of bottled water are close to neutral. Someone actually did this and posted it on YouTube showing that Disani was one of the most acidic of the of the bottle water brands. "
