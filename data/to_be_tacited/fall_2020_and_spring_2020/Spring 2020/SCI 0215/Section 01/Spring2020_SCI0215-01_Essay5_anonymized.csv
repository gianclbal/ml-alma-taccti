2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,620,"I want to go into my major because I feel like it’s very important to have a background in science before going to medical school. I don’t think it’s bad that some people go into medical school without a science major and pursue a major with a low amount of credits to have more room to take science classes, but I feel like the lower division science classes help warm some people up for the classes they take in the future. Btw, I’ll miss u guys :) . Thanks for being such great SCI instructors and I’ll definitely keep in touch if I have any questions about my pathway to medical school :D ."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,623,"I'm a kinesiology major and I wanted to go into it because I am interested in optimizing the human body and getting it to function correctly. I like the sciences, nutrition, and health and wanted to study something that incorporated all of those. I wanted to be able to go into an industry that helps heal people and I thought physical therapy would be a great fit for me. I like working with people and am very hands on, and this is a career where there isn't much time in the day that you're sitting down. I really liked the idea of being very active in my career and can't imagine myself with an office job. Of course there's a financial motivation as well, I chose a major/career path that I knew would be stable and needed forever. I want to be able to support myself and a future family so there's that too. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,615,"I decided to major is Zoology because I've always loved animals. I knew that it was going to be a tough four years in college since it's a STEM major but I decided to do it anyways. We live in a world where the animal kingdom does not receive the attention it deserves and I want to be a part of that community because animals deserve all the treatment and equality. Eventually, I want to use to my major and go into vet school if I ever get the opportunity to do so. I love house pets and am willing to work with them. I grew up loving dogs my whole life so I thought it would be the perfect career to get into, saving dogs lives or helping them medically. Overall, I plan to use the pre-requisites from my Zoology major to get into veterinary school in hopes of become a veterinary doctor."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,405,"I am currently a Cell and Molecular Biology major and I feel like I will be sticking with this to the end of my bachelor of science years at SFSU. I originally signed up to be a general bio major when applying to SFSU because I found that I had a passion in science during high school and it just seemed like I would like having a career in science for the majority of my working life. Not to mention, my dad and one of my aunts are biochemistry majors from SFSU so perhaps there's some science that runs in the family as well.I chose to do biology since physics isn't one of my strong suits in science and I couldn't apply to be a chemistry major for some reason when applying for SFSU. But I think it will turn alright in the end. I enjoy both biology and chemistry and my major does require me to take chemistry courses. I have found that I like working with microorganisms and that I am interested in seeing how well I can do in a career in genetics. If I can apply my knowledge of chemistry to living things, then I think I don't have to necessarily major in chemistry to do so. Plus, I see the CMB major as a more flexible way for me to learn more about microorganisms and genetics once I get into my upper division major classes versus a microbiology major. I am also considering minoring in Chinese. I think I will; I just need to get the paperwork for it done. Chinese 101 and 102 are going to cover my Area C lower division GE and some SF State Studies. I feel like minoring in Chinese is good for me to do since I do want to become better and maybe even fluent in Chinese. I would like to get more in touch with my Chinese background and minoring in Chinese seems like it's right for me with the amount of course work I'm adding on top of my science degree. Majoring in Chinese just seems like too much classes I'm adding on top of my CMB course work. I also am not planning to study abroad in Taiwan or China, so that is why I think a minor in Chinese is good for me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,611,"My major is biology. I chose this major is because ever since I was a child I always had a fascination with how the body work and interaction between human and their environment. Another reason why I chose general biology as my major is it offers me more aspects of biology like ecology, to cells, and marine without being focus on one field. This would allow me have more flexibility in my career because I don’t want to pick a major that I will later on change to sometime else. I also see biology as an important subject to understanding of a complex forms of life involving humans, animals, and plants. As it help to develops interests in the lives of living organisms in an effort to preserve them. I also chose this major as in the future I hope to be able to use this major to help people. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,612,"This is easy. I want to go into veterinary medicine and eventually become a small animal vet or a large animal vet such as horses and cattle. Not sure what branch of veterinary medicine, but I am sure that I want to work with animals because they are the most vulnerable with no voice as well as not being able to help themselves. It has been my childhood dream to work with animals and I am currently on the pathway of getting a concentration in zoology as well as adding a minor or two. I applied to transfer at UC Davis by working my butt off and getting the best grades I have ever gotten so that I can pursue a career in animal science. My father used to be a professional racehorse trainer all over the country and whenever he was in California, I would go to work with him and see all the horses. Since then, I have always been surrounded and passionate about animals as well as being a vegetarian for 12 years now. I am very excited to be finally be taking more biology classes next semester also being done with most of my G.E.s."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,619,"I am currently a biology major with a physiology emphasis and chemistry minor ( waiting to add another minor just not sure which one). I've talked to my advisor and he said it would be better to add another minor to make the med school application look better, so hopefully I'll do that soon and it will be related to health-sciences. With my major I really really hope to get into med school and hopefully later become a neurosurgeon. I've been into medicine since I was really young because most of my family are in this industry, and growing up with it has helped me a lot. Neuro is currently my top 1 choice, but I am obviously open to other specialties, I really hope to get a view of all of them in med school and going with an open mind is really important to see what I really like once I can experience it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,624,"I want to go into my major because I want to be a doctor. Not just any doctor I want to subspecialize as a neonatal specialist they are the doctors that take care of premature babies. I know what you are thinking ok why that specifically? Ill tell you its because I don't necessarily feel a debt to them but I have an admiration for what they do because I was saved by them. When I was born I came out a 6-month-old preemie and it was because of these doctors I am here now. Because technology and more importantly the education they received is at the soul and heart of not just my situation but others. So in following in their footsteps, I can give to those what those doctors did to me. That is a fighting chance to succeed, so here I am now trying to follow the footsteps of the greats in a sort of way. To give back and have a natural cycle, because who knows one day I might save a preemie just like me and he will grow up to do the same thing  I did. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,606,I want to go into my major because I thought Kinesiology best suited me the most. I've always been interested in the human body and how it functioned as a whole. I thought kinesiology would lead me to a career where I'll study and learn more about the human body and how to apply it to everyday life. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,621,"STEM has not always been what I was interested in, until I became a sophomore in high school. I wanted to be a lawyer for a long time to fight back injustices done to the community. While I still want to do that I started to fall in love with medicine. I really like biology and chemistry but it wasn't until I started to research more about medicine that I realized that I wanted to be a doctor. I watch a lot of doctor shows and want to do exactly what they're doing, but like for real not just for some drama show. I have family members who are doctors and have always been inspired by their work. I want to still be able to give back to my community, especially in El Salvador and I plan on moving back once I get credited for my medical license. I want to be a pediatrician and give back to those kids who don't have it all and all the access to medical attendance. There are not enough Latinas in the STEM field and I want to change that statistic even if it is by one person. Science revolves us everyday and it fascinates me which is why I want to study it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,617,"Main reason why I chose my major was so it would prepare me well for medical school but I also chose it because I love Biology and I love studying about living things, the human body because there are just so many incredible things that I never realized made us well us. Its really amazing to see how the world works from the small things to all the way to the overall picture. Even though I haven't yet taken that many bio classes from the one's I have taken so far its really interesting to learn about how the world works. I hope I can continue this journey and acquiring more knowledge about myself and the world and I hope I get to apply that to the real world. I also want to learn more about research and what new things scientists are discovering or making experiments about. I hope I can join a research lab soon."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,610,"I want to go into my major because ultimately my goal is to attend medical school. My first year at SFSU I was a pre-nursing major and when I started working at Kaiser, and spoke to some physicians and coworkers and I got inspired to achieve something higher. I want to help communities that are in need of medical attention regardless of their financial situation. I am also passionate about learning about the human body and the processes that go around us. I also find it interesting to learn about things that go around our everyday lives like physics. I love attending my major classes and stem courses because it makes me think deeper and challenge my thinking. It is difficult now being a stem major to learn hands off rather than being in person. I enjoy talking with those in my classes and learning the similarities and differences that we all share. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,616,"Silverio Flores-Garcia SCI-215Reflective Journaling Essay #5My major is Biology with a concentration in Physiology. I hope to either go to graduate school and do research for the Smithsonian or go to med school to become a Physician in emergency medicine. Currently, I hold a position as a UCSB Smithsonian Scholar which gives me access to many internships, fellowships and off-grid work in research/lab experience. As of Summer 2019, I went on a trip to Panama to research endangered species through various hardships such as coding with a program called R studio. Researching in groups to find a hypothesis and prove the hypothesis through field experiments such as camera trapping, surveillance, and series of protocols to ensure that our hypothesis matches our results. As a result, I got to study culture, environmental landscapes, communities, and species only native to selective places around the world. Also conducted research using GPS coordinates on an island called BCI which is a private island only available to those that are scientists and researchers. This opportunity has broadened my borders in terms of a world of research. As in terms of becoming a Physician, I find myself quite intrigued by the human body and the limitations that it could possibly reach. When I was at the age of 12, my father got me an anatomy book that taught the various bones, ligaments, tendons, joints and other different infrastructures. When High school came around I received a certificate that verifies me with college credit for kinesiology and sports medicine. Physiology comes easy to me and it is one of my most interesting topics and I enjoy reading scientific research on many components/functions of the human body as it has become a hobby of mine. I have the support of my passed professors from my community college and other peers that I have come in contact with on my journey of pursuing higher education. My networking system consists of various people who excel in their professions and those who provide insight into the world of medicine and research."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,613,"I chose Pre-Biology at first because science is my favorite subject, and since I was a kid I wanted to become a pediatrician. I get along with kid pretty good. But I changed my major to Microbiology B.S because Pre-Biology is a BA, and I'm planning to go to graduate school after this. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,614,"I want to go into my major for various reasons. For example, it is clear that i have had an interest and passion for earth science, so i find biology to be really interesting. It makes me happy and so I want to pursue something that makes me happy. There's a lot to learn and i find it all exciting to learn about. I like being in the biology community, especially at school because people are usually very understanding and helpful with one another. I want to use this passion for biology to apply it to my future career, where I'm able to help individuals, ecological communities, and individuals. It feels nice fulfilling this major because it's a useful and challenging one that pays off in the end. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,605,"This is honestly a good question because I don't think I’ve put a lot of thought into this lately. Sometimes I forget the actual reason I wanted to be a biochem major. I think I originally wanted to be a pharmacist because I believed helping people through medicine is something I’d want to do. As I grew up and lived more I began to see the ethical difficulty I would have been a pharmacist giving out countless drugs to people that either don’t need it or rely on them so much to function. I don’t think I’d live a happy life being a mule for pharmaceutical greed. I’m still a biochem major because I still firmly believe progressing science is one thing that’ll inevitably help us. Where my part in all that is unknown right now. But I have a few more years of college so I’ll hopefully figure it out towards the end of this journey. Until then, I’ll live my life as a biochem major, and both love and hate it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,576,"I want to go into the STEM field because I am currently a nurse and would like to broaden my knowledge.  I enrolled here at San Francisco State University to achieve a degree in MicroBiology, so that I can apply to Medical School. My long term goal is to volunteer for Doctors Without Borders, helping the underprivileged would be a great blessing in my life. I hope to inspire others to take action as well . I want to travel the globe with them and help save as many lives as possible. I find science and medicine extremely interesting. I come from a family of nurses and doctors and have always appreciated what they do. Volunteering for Doctors Without Borders will allow me to fulfill my love for travel, science and service. I would like to focus my studies in the field of neuroscience, I find the brain to be extremely fascinating. It's still the most unknown topic of the human body!!! Maybe I can help with the creation of an effective Alzheimer's medication or deterint. My studies at SFSU have driven my passion for knowledge even more. The more I learn the more I wish to achieve higher education. I got the drive to apply for medical school from working."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,609,"I want to go to my Cell and Molecular Biology major because I want to go into research. There isn’t a specific topic I’m passionate about, but I am highly motivated to be put in a position where I can help give back to my community in some form. Currently I’m in Nicole Adelstein’s research lab(chemistry) where we work on battery research to find more energy efficient lithium batteries. I was originally an environmental science major because climate change is a problem I’d like to help play a role in fixing(since it will require huge amounts of efforts from many people) and being part of a research lab to find more eco friendly forms of energy is rewarding. I want to follow that rewarding feeling and I’ll take up on any opportunities that let me work on current issues. Luckily, being a funded researcher, I can prepare for a PhD in the stem field, probably something in the BioChem field."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,117,"I still don't have an exact idea of why I want to go into my major. I guess money and stability are part of it, although majoring in biology may not always be the most lucrative. Familial pressure is another one. My sister recommended that I go into Biology and so I did. I'm mostly neutral about it. I think that I want to work in a lab although I don't have prior experience. College should be about exploration and I got accepted in the Genentech scholarship, so I hope to get an idea of what it's like. Maybe I might want to go into research; I'm not sure at this point yet. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,607,"My major is Kinesiology with a Concentration in Exercise and Movement Sciences. I am pursuing a doctorate degree in Physical Therapy, hopefully in Pediatrics. I have volunteered in Physical Therapy offices and those experiences have validated my choice of becoming a PT. The initial reason why I want to become a PT is because of my mom and what she went through a couple years ago. She had a risky kidney procedure and after the surgery, she had to go through physical therapy. When she went back home, I remember I assisted her in walking to the bathroom and the impact that I had to her recovery. Something so simple like that can impact a person's life, and it definitely impacted mine. There is something that is so special in helping an individual gain mobility and strength in their body. The impact that I've seen PTs have on patients is tremendous because they help patients who are dependent on their assistance to become independent. Having that skill with people is sort of like having a superpower, and I want to have that superpower one day. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,622,"The reason why I chose the STEM field going into college was due to my overwhelming love and understanding for science since grade school. I felt that this was the place I belonged to the most and after taking the prerequisites for my major I have never felt more like I made the right decision. I will say, the classes are not easy all the time, however it has never hindered my thoughts of whether or not I chose the right field. Another reason why I chose the STEM field was due to the career choice that I am still debating. Although I have not solidified what I would like to pursue in my career I know for a fact that wherever I end up I would still like to be involved in the STEM field. This may or may not include lab work, an office, or in the field doing observations. The STEM field viewed through my eyes is one of the most innovative fields there are because as much as we know already there is still so much out there that has not been discovered yet. This is what makes this field so exciting, that there can be new discoveries every day, there's never a boring day on the job."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,618,"I wanted to be a bio major because in the future I want to be able to work in a health clinic helping families and children. Now I am not sure as to what yet but that is the direction I want to head in. I come from a small poor town and I would like to give back maybe to my own community someday. I am bilingual, Spanish was my first language and I know how hard it is for some families who don't speak English at all can be really confused by what physicians tell them. I would really like to work with lower-income families because I am from one and I think they deserve more attention. I’m not really sure what specifically I want to do but I know for sure that I want to head in this direction in my career."
