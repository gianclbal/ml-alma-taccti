Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,576,"I am taking a SCI helper class to better understand what I am learning in class. I am taking both a Physics-121 SCI course and Chemistry-215 SCI course. I enjoy it because it is forced studying in a productive manner. I forgot where I read this, but many educators say for every unit you take you should be studying one hour per unit your class is worth. I am taking sixteen units therefore I should be studying sixteen hours a week. These SCI classes will help me accomplish that through, making myself accountable to go to class each week and get extra help. It is amazing review and reflection time on what we just learned in class. It also gives you an opportunity to ask any questions that you have, that you were unable to ask in class due to time. I also like hearing from different people on how they are learning the material because it might also help me. It is very helpful to have someone in the same shoes as you, since you are taking the class together it is a much better time to get to know your class mates and forum study groups. So far from the first three weeks / four weeks of class I have gotten A’s on all my quizzes given in my main classes thanks to my SCI helper classes. I do not regret taking these classes at all, actually I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to take these classes."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,605,"I am here because I was born into a society that deemed it necessary to acquire higher education to obtain any resemblance of a good life. A good life being objective as good isn’t the same for everyone. In this class specifically I am here to make up a grade that I received in my first year. I am here because two people had sex and one of them pushed me out of her vaginal canal. To make it clear, I don’t want to be here. Not right now at least. But I am here because this is the life the world believes is the path to a life without struggle and without hardship. I honestly can’t think of any more reasons as to why I’m here. It’s not for fun I’ll tell you that off the bat. Maybe I am here to learn about different cultures and observe life without the guidance of anyone but my own. Who knows?"
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,606,"The reason why I am here is because I take any opportunity that will aid me in my future to reach my career. Since I have not taken chemistry in over three years, having sci course will hopefully keep my grade up for chemistry 2. I have taken a sci course back in chemistry 115, and I would say that it a major help. Being able to work on worksheets and make mistakes on it and learn from it is a great environment. I learn best when I am in a class setting working with other students and peers. After I graduate this semester, I hope I would receive an A in my chemistry 215 lecture and after go into chiropractic college for that is my goal. My major goal is to run my own practice and to serve people the holistic side of healthcare and not only be limited to western medicine. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,405,"I am here today in SCI 215 to give myself a safety net for chemistry just in case I don't get around to studying the concepts I have learned in lecture and lab. I still remember my experiences not taking SCI when I was completing my BIO 230 and 240 pathway and when I took SCI for Chem 115. I'd have to say that SCI would have benefited me if I took it for BIO 240 as it would have given me a time to where I'd be motivated to study, memorize, and do the content I have been learning in class. I didn't realize this until I got my feet wet with SCI for Chem 115. Now I feel like I will be taking more SCI courses in the future as I see how beneficial they are in motivating me to practice what I have been learning in class. So far, I think my decision has been paying off. I think it is worth it, it's a chill class for me to work on Chem 215 with great people on a relaxing Friday. Not to mention, I can get inspiration from this SCI class and apply it to my SCI session for Math 227."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,607,"I am in this class because I need assistance in my Chemistry class. The last time I took Chemistry was about 2 years ago back in my community college and I was struggling with the subject. I remember having a tough time understanding the concepts even though I attended supplemental instruction (they called it “SI”) from a past student. I am glad that I took this SCI course because Natalia and Stephanie really ensure that we understand the concept before they move on to the next topic. They do not judge if we get a question wrong, which is a major thing for me because it makes me feel more comfortable to actually ask questions. Additionally, I signed up for this class because I need an A (lowest a B) in this class because this class is a prerequisite for Physical Therapy school. Anyways, I do appreciate the time and effort that the SCI instructors put into this class because I do see a difference in my understanding of quantitative chemistry."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,608,"I am here because I want to further my education. I have always had an interest in science and once I was in my senior year of high school, I decided I wanted to pursue a career in it. That is why I am at San Francisco State. I hope to get my Bachelor’s Degree in biochemistry and hopefully get into medical school. In medical school, I would study pathology to eventually become a pathologist. I love lab work and am very intrigued by the work of a pathologist. Working amongst scientists to find the causes and cures of diseases is my main career goal and I would love to have a job in which I would look forward to going to everyday. This is why I am here right now. I am studying and taking classes in order to graduate. Graduating can help lead me down the path which reaches my goal."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,609,"I’m here because I’m trying to major in the STEM field, specifically I want to enroll in a PhD program after graduating with a B.S in Cell and Molecular Biology. However, recently I’ve been enjoying some of my prereq classes for my major such as physics and chemistry. Even though I never had the chance to take many chemistry classes before, I’m here to dip my toes in other STEM fields. I suppose I’m taking this SCI Chemistry course so that I can expand my general chemistry knowledge to see if I can apply chemistry concepts in my future research work. By enrolling in this SCI Chemistry course, I’m learning to apply lecture concepts onto real world applications. This is helpful since it will reinforce my confidence in chemistry concepts, and that confidence will help me feel more at ease in research environments (specifically research labs for PhD programs). Despite being a biology major, I genuinely believe that understanding chemistry concepts will be applicable in my future research work."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,610,"I decided to take this class this semester because I am also taking Biology and Physics. My schedule is a little overwhelming right now and I felt that although I succeeded in CHEM 115, I know CHEM 215 has more to do with math and I thought this course would help to structure my learning and force me to study the lecture notes. Why am I here in general I would say to  pursue a career in medicine, I am a first generation college student and I want to make my family proud and let them know that their struggles were not for nothing. With the advantage I am at with the support of my family I intend to provide care and give medical relief to those without access to the care and resources everyone deserves. I chose to come to SFSU in order to still be close to home and limit debt as much as possible so early on in my life of learning. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,611,"The reason why I'm taking this sci class is to improve my grade for Chem 215 as this class is more about calculation than Chem 115. My worst subject has always be math, so I thought that maybe by taking the sci class it would help me to improve my math skills. So far the sci class is really helping me as it allow me to have a general ideas of possible questions and topics that might be appear on the exam. This allow me to focus on what I really need to study for the exam. As something I tend to study materials that is not even in the exam. Another reason why I took this class is to meet new people as it good thing to make more friends. More friends mean more people to study with. We can help each other on topics that we are not strong in."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,612,"I am taking an SI course because I am setting aside judgement that getting help and asking for help is okay. I did not feel like I struggled in chem 115, which is why I did not take the SI course with it last semester. However, I also do not feel like I am struggling in chem 215, but I wanted to try something new and do much better in chemistry. I thought to myself, what would the harm be in taking a SI course? After multiple students had walked in most of my STEM classes, I thought why not give it a try and add it to my schedule? After my first class session in the SI class, I came out with so much clarity and understanding, that there is no way I could bare skipping this class. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,613,"I'm here to learn about chemistry. At first, I took Chemistry because it was required for my major, but my feeling towards this course changed because chem 115 was fun. I was kind of worried about taking 215 because a lot of people were saying that it was a hard course, and that's the reason that I'm taking the side course. But I'm thinking of adding chemistry as my minor since I need to take organic chemistry."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,614,"I'm enrolled in the chem 215 sci course for several reasons. I want to make sure that the concepts I learn in my parent course, are reinforced in the sci class so that I have a good understanding of them. I feel like the lecture course can be confusing at times, so I believe the sci course will help with clarifying those confusions. I have taken sci classes before, and I took SCI 115 last semester which I found was useful for my success in Chem 115. Being in a sci class makes it easy to ask questions and work with the people around me so that we have discussions about the concepts-- comparing to the large 100+ people class. Here we can compare notes or go over topics that we may have not gone over yet. The sci course also helps improve my GPA and gives me an extra unit, so it doesn't hurt to take it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,117,"I am here for numerous reasons I suppose. Firstly, I have a pretty big gap between my biology and ochem lectures so taking this course would minimize it. Also, I’ve heard that chem 215 is more challenging so I thought that taking this sci course would be helpful. I’ve heard that people who take SCI do better in the course and while I feel like I would’ve somewhat been fine without taking it, I don’t regret taking this course. Also, the Genentech scholars program that I’m currently in recommended us to take SCI courses, so here I am. In a broader, more general sense, I am here at SF State because I want to get a degree and get a good job. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,615,"I am here in San Francisco all the way from Los Angeles to get my degree. I chose to come up here because I've always wanted to come to the bay area since in my opinion is a beautiful city. I always wanted to remain in a city since I come from a city which should not make me feel different or homesick. I've always wanted to help animals ever since I was a little girl, specifically dogs, because I love them so much. I'm here for myself and most importantly my parents. My parents always enforced me to go to school to have a better future because they always remind me that they are immigrants and they did not have the same opportunities that I do in this country so I have to take advantage of that. Therefore, I am here today to become a professional with my degree :)."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,616,"Silverio FloresReflective Journal Essay # 1 Why Am I Here?Hello, my name is Silverio (Silver) Flores, I am a first-generation college student. I am here to complete the path that I have always wanted to complete. I am a transfer student from SBCC. I graduated with 3 AA degrees that are STEM-related. I have been through some tough barriers that make it hard for being of a different ethnic background to achieve a career in the Pre-med field. I am here to inspire people to consider joining STEM-related careers not only for themselves but to better the future generations to come. I come from a family of 5 brothers and I’m the second oldest brother in the family so it's extremely stressful to evaluate every move that I make so that I could become a good role model to all my brother so that the path of obtaining a higher education could be possible through hard work and dedication. My long term goal is to become a Physician in Emergency Medicine. To achieve this I have enrolled in this class to lighten the weight of Chemistry 215. I want to reach a goal of getting in A in Chemistry 215."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,617,The reason why I signed up for the SCI 215 class was to get extra help for Chem 215 because it is a challenging class and I did to make sure I understand the concepts I didn't understand in class. Sometimes in such a big classroom it is hard to ask questions to your professor which was another reason why I signed up for this class because I get one on one help from my peers and also the SCI facilitators. I also want to be able to pass Chem 215 with an A which is why I signed up for sci so I can get the extra help to pass the class. It also easier to ask questions and get help so I don't fall behind in class and get motivated to study more. I also learn how to collaborate more with my peers and ask more questions. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,618,So I am here taking this class mostly because I need help. The lecture is only twice a week and our professor talks really fast and I sometimes miss the point and it’s also easier to understand when a classmate or a group is doing the work with you and actually helping you figure it out. I’ve taken and SCI class before and every time I participate in asking questions I always do better on exams and on homework.It is also reassuring knowing that I’m not the only one who is like “what are we doing in class” sometimes. I just like the help from everyone.
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,619,"Why am I here? First of all, I am in this class to get as much help as I can with chemistry. Chemistry is not easy for me at all, I like it, but it has been one of the hardest subjects for me since High School. I am currently a Biol - Physio major, which means I have to take chemistry whether I like it or not. With this class, I not only hope to get as much help as I can but also to meet people in order to make a study group and make connections for the future. Why am I in college? I hope to get into Medical School after SFSU, hoping to become a doctor later on in my life. I first chose San Francisco State because I was a fashion design major until I changed it to Bio last semester, but it was a really good school and city for all fashion related things. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,620,"I feel that I'm here because I am that dedicated to make sure that I learn the material thoroughly, and that means taking an extra class to do better in another one. This was also the one unit I needed in order to consider myself as a full-time student, so it worked out perfectly. I love coming to class with people having the same drive and motivation as I do to learn the required material and helping others out if they run into trouble. In addition, I want to get better at public speaking and I feel that this class can help with that since i might consider being a tutor for a lower level science class. Helping others get motivated to learn satisfies me so much and it builds new friendships that have a strong base. The environment that is promoted in this class is created and maintained in a way that does not involve putting down others and filled with asking questions, which helps me learn also."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,621,"I am here because Chemistry is a really challenging subject and I need all the extra help I can get. I took Chem 115 last semester with a SCI class and it helped me get an A in the class. However chem 215 is a harder course and I knew I was going to need more help on it. I'm the type of person who learns by doing things over and over again and that's what chemistry is sort of about, especially having lab and having SCI. I want to go into the medical field so having a good foundation on the beginning stages of Chemistry is an important factor to my stages of getting to med school. Chemistry can be fun and exciting if it's understood, however can be easily frustrating and difficult if you get lost along the way. That's why I am here in this supplementary course."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,622,"I am here in this class because this course really helps in boosting GPA’s and helping me stay on track with studying. I have previously taken a SCI 115 course and it heavily contributed to bettering my study habits. Last semester I took chemistry 115 and sci 115 concurrently and it helped me understand more about the parent class. I ended the semester with a B- and I thought after getting such a good grade personally for me I would give it another try. This leads me to take another sci class, one for a level up chemistry course than I have previously taken. Without the previous sci course I most definitely would have struggled more and possibly even failed. The most helpful part of the course is when we sit in groups and the team work really helps due to peer mentoring. This is the reason why I am here."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,623,"I am here in a Sci course because I have an awareness of my chemistry and math abilities and I know that I could use the extra help. I have never been very strong at math in particular and I want to do well in my chemistry class so I am trying to hone my skills and improve at conceptually understanding how to apply the math to the problems. I also think that this Sci class is a good way to meet more people and I always look to my peers for extra support. They are such a great resource to have for answering various questions that come up and I think that one of the best ways to learn is by teaching, so relying on each other also gives us the opportunity to grow our knowledge of the topics. By being in this class I believe I can not only pass Chem 215 with a better grade, but also get through it with a better understanding of the material and so that is why I’m here."
