2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,614,"When life gets challenging, I do a number of things to help me. I try to talk about my feelings and the issues I’m going through, with my friends and family because they can support me. I do activities that help me reduce my stress, because stress makes challenges in life more challenging. For example, I’ll think, take deep breaths, take a warm shower, turn on my aromatherapy diffuser, listen to music, sing, dance clean, and go on walks. I feel like these are good ways for me to calm down during challenging times, and help me reduce my stress. However, I know that there is a limit to how much I can do all these things since they’re just pacifying me. So, I remember that I need to think about solutions about how to overcome the challenging times—which is when I will usually write or talk about it to myself, and ask for help from others about how I’m feeling or how I can overcome my issues.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,610,"When life begins to get challenging, I try to look for people or things in my life that have contributed to my happiness or peacefulness. I reflect on all of the good that has happened to me and the great people I have in my life. In order to overcome those challenges, I look within and think of strategies to overcome the challenges while trying to keep my mental health in check. It is definitely easier said than done but it is good to kind of put yourself and your own health first before whatever is becoming challenging in life. I know for me, life got really challenging when I began to work 40-hour weeks at work because I was on my probation period for 3 months and at that same time, I was a full-time student and I commuted for about 5 hours roundtrip. Looking back on it, I can see how I neglected not only my mental but also my physical health and that’s why those are some of the top things that are my top priorities when searching for a plan to move forward and conquer the challenge. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,576,"When life gets challenging, there are several things I do. My favorite thing to do is remember how far I have come in life and the adversity I have already faced. Most of the time I have endured worse in one way or another. I enjoy meditation and smoking marijuana when I am feeling overwhelmed with life. Persistence and positivity are my driving forces to reach my goals.  I remember one of my teachers saying “keep on trying even if it gets hard and you need to go at a slower pace. I'd rather be forty five and a doctor rather than forty five and not a  doctor”. Her telling me this made me not fear failure, and it really stuck with me. Anything can be accomplished with the right amount of time. One of my all time favorite quotes is “Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass. It’s about learning how to dance in the rain”. I feel as if this quote directly correlates to our prompt (what do I do when life gets challenging) and the quote to me means, you don’t allow anything to deter you from reaching your full potential. You don't just wait for bad things in your life to go away, instead, you have a positive attitude and take challenges head on and enjoy the journey. At the end of the day when all is said and done just try your best, and remember the journey is usually the best part !"
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,620,"When life gets challenging, I like to reach out to my friends and family for any sort of help and see if they could assist me in my goals. I like to do the same for others because I know that everyone is going through something at one point in their lives and I like to reach out if they need it. I always remember to never give up, because that’s when everything falls apart and it makes people even more sad if they decide to do so. As a result, I always tell people that they should never give up because by doing that, you have essentially devalued yourself and your ability to exceed your goals and make it harder for them to mature as life goes on. In SCI 215, whenever anyone has a question about a topic, I like to help in anyway I can even though it is hard for me to explain my thought process, but I know that I’m helping someone achieve their goal, and that’s all that matters to me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,616,"Silverio Flores-GarciaSCI-215Reflective Journaling Essay #2When life gets challenging, I try to find many ways to solve my problems by looking at the situation through various points of view. I tend to not give up or sleep until my problems are solved. I believe that the more you put off problems the more they tend to pile up and often occupy space that you need. As a result, by forgetting the problem and trying to move forward you take two steps backwards because one tends to use up energy, thinking and time when you will fix the current challenging situation. I take constructive criticism seriously because I rather have the truth and learn from my mistakes rather than dealing with them later in a bad timing situation. I often seek advice from my parents or my five brothers or even friends/peers. I think it's important that you don't face any problems alone as you could be countering the situation in a one-view biased situation, which involves you never got to fix the situation."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,611,"When life get challenging for me I usually try to think and look from a positive point of view because for me staying frustrated doesn’t really help solve the problem. I believe that when you are in a positive mood it much more easier to think of a solution. I also try to look at this challenge as a lesson because it help me to learn from this and how to overcome later on in life. We all face failure at once in our lifetime so instead of looking at that failure as a defeat, look at it as a feedback in how do better next time. It doesn’t matter how many times we fall as long as we choose to get up and learn from it. That what I try to do when I face a difficult situation. We all human so we all are going to make mistakes. When the situation become too much for me I usually go and talk to my family about it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,609,"When life gets challenging, I tend to distract myself usually with school or homework. For example, when I got my identity stolen, I focused most of my attention on school than with adulting problems. I don’t like to think about problems, I’d rather ignore it until I can’t ignore it. However, if it’s school that gets challenging, I seek out help or any resources because I don’t like to struggle. If the problem that is making my life challenging is out of my control, I’d rather disassociate from reality by turning to sci-fi tv shows or just playing videogames instead. Recently with the whole COVID-19 crisis, I bought Sims 4 on my PS4 and I played it all throughout spring break to forget all the problems that are out of my control and live a different life for a little while. To sum it up, if life gets challenging, I try to mentally escape my situation for a while to recharge before continuing the daily struggle of life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,624,"Definitely getting accustomed to this new schedule work load because now I'm reading on the train off thee train and preparing for classes around the clock. I have grown accustomed to really appreciate my free time because of that because once I'm on campus I treat school as work and want to excel in it. In addition, the lab for chem is more complicated with the extra courses but I like the added challenge it keeps me on my toes so so far I reach out to friends in the class if I have a need for help or have sci to reinforce my understanding in the topics. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,117,"I guess that my usual instinctive reaction is to give up and say 'this is too hard'. But I know that there are a lot of support systems not only on campus, but at home or with my friends. What I guess that I should do and try to develop a good strategy for rising up to the challenge. This could mean developing and practicing resilience and determination, especially self-confidence. I need to be more confident in my own skills and abilities and know that there are people that can help me if I only ask them to. It's comforting to know that there are other people that face similar challenges everyday and that I can do it if they can do it. When life gets challenging, it's easy to capitulate but I'm learning that I need to take advantage of every opportunity to learn and grow if I want to be successful. This journal is reminiscent of one I did in physics lab last semester but I am a lot more positive writing this one. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,621,"When life gets challenging it's always hard to think about the good that might come. It's hard to see the silver lining of things and in most cases we, or I tend to shut down and get extremely frustrated. I am pretty much a control freak and feel that life gets challenging when I don't have everything under control and in most cases it has a lot to do with school where everything gets to overwhelming. Some things I do when  I feel like life is getting really challenging is listen to music. Music serves me as a distraction from anything happening around me, a way to escape. I tend to listen to music whenever I get too overwhelmed because I feel like some songs just know how to distract you or can make you feel not alone because it can feel like the artist knows what you're going through. School tends to drive us crazy and make it seem like it's too challenging because of the amount of stress students have can make it even harder for students to really focus on how to deal with life getting challenging but I believe that everyone has their own ways to deal with. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,613,"I feel like every day is a challenge for me since I'm an immigrant in the United States, so I just have a mindset that I have to outwork everybody to feel like I'm at the same level as others. The way that I learned English was by dedication, and practice, so I just translated that mindset into college. But going to office hours helps to clear some challenges that you have in whichever course."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,608,"When life gets challenging, it is easy to feel as if everyone and everything is against you. I’ve had this feeling several times. I am a full time student with a part-time job and time is something I have always struggled with. Not only that, but I also have things to do at home. I have every day tasks I need to complete and sometimes I feel overwhelmed, especially at a time like this. If keeping up with all my classes wasn’t hard enough, now I have to do everything online and am already struggling to keep up. The good thing is that I am also taking a psychology class where we have learned that stress is very unhealthy and there are many ways to learn to cope with it. What I like to do when life gets challenging, is take some time for myself and just take a couple deep breaths. I have to think about how other people have it far worse than I do. I also like to listen to music which can help calm me, and when i’m ready, surround myself with my favorite people. They always lighten my mood and remind me everything will be okay"
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,619,"What do I do when life gets challenging? When life gets challenging there are a few things I've learned to do to calm myself down for a little bit until everything else gets a little bit better at least. First of all, I like to pause everything for a minute and breathe. Breathing exercises have helped me a lot throughout these past years, specially during test and final season. Another way is to do a sport. Since I was young I've been playing different sports and I have notices with time that these help with anxiety and just in general with stressful situations because it gets my mind off things. Lastly, talking to my family and spending time with my friends also helps a lot because I get to get my mind off things as well and enjoy while being able to talk to them about what is going on. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,606,"What I do when life gets challenging is to organize my priorities before I handle any task. Staying organized throughout my plan is very important because it causes less stress and I can look into what I need to finish beforehand and certain deadlines due. I also like to schedule out how many breaks I have in between. Having breaks is essential for me to recuperate and get a little breather before I handle any other tasks. I try to not to have stress enter in my mind, but it's an inevitable human emotion, but I can do my best to decrease it as much as possible.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,405,"I'm still trying to figure out ways to deal with life when it gets challenging. I've been noticing that I'm better at coping with adversity when it rears its ugly shadow around the corner. Over the years, I've gained some knowledge on what coping mechanisms work for me. I just keep pushing through the week and hope things get better. I find that talking to my friends, going on social media for a few hours for alone time, lying in bed, spending time with my roommate, or spending time with family does the trick in removing stress. I know that some days and weeks can be harder than usual and this week was one of them with having to adjust to classes moving online, moving most of my stuff back home from my place on-campus, and leaving my roommate behind in our place alone. I know that in the back of my mind, things will be okay in the end. I hope that things get better with COVID-19 and the rest of the semester will go smoothly. I'm not sure what the school will do next school year if things are still like this with the virus, but we'll deal with it if we get to that point."
