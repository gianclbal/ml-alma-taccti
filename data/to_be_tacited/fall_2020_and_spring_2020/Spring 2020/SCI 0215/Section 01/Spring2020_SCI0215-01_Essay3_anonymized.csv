2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,605,"I was raised to not be any trouble to anyone and to get whatever issues that I may have out of the way on my own. The latter being a personal belief that was probably a subconscious idea that stemmed from the primary. But to me, I firmly believe that my problems are not the problems of anyone else. Part of being an adult is being responsible for your own actions, with that has to come the ability to solve a majority of your problems. This mindset has helped me live a fulfilling life through college because I’ve met people from different parts of life and have gotten into a lot of trouble because of my own stupidity. Having to deal with those issues on my own is something that’s helped me grow into a less stupid human being. Without the mindset of solidarity, I don’t believe I would’ve grown as much as I have if someone were constantly bailing me out of my mess-ups."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,405,"I feel like I have a place at SFSU now. Going into college as a freshman back in 2018, I felt like I was very limited in life experience and people I could relate to with being a newbie in college. The people around me were as follows: some of my family members who were already college graduates (my dad and two of my aunts) and on social media: people who I follow that are older than me--who either had already having graduated college, on their last stretch of college, haven't gone to college, or currently in graduate school--and people who are around the same age as me in college, but a stranger I haven't connected with.I felt a bit isolated with people who I can relate to once I started college as the realization of how large of a sandbox the world is for me to play with. All these new freedoms and experiences were bringing me into a place I never been to before and it does fill me up with anxiety when I'm trying something out I feel a bit uncomfortable with or nervous about due to a lack of experience. I think that it's good to step outside of one's comfort zone to try out new things to expand your horizons, but it can be hard for me to take that extra step to at times due for aforementioned nervousness, and it can suck. I appreciate how college has led me to meet and connect with classmates and roommates who I can relate to. It's comforting to know how having someone to talk to about college struggles and reminding myself that others are probably facing the same situations as me (for example: stressed out about homework because of time management issues and staying up late to finish an assignment). These opportunities for me to connect with classmates around the same age as me, taking the same class as me, and/or going through the same college process as me makes me feel at home with the SFSU community. I appreciate the opportunities of social interaction college brings to me and I hope that I make someone else feel like they belong in SFSU with our connection going to the same school in return."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,610,"I think the different communities that I am part of really value the importance of education and through some mentors guidance I have been able to make my way through college. On the other hand, I feel that my families origin specifically my grandparents, family living in Mexico, etc. don't see the value in education. They feel that after high school (school that is mandated) one should go straight to work in order to help your parents pay bills and run the household. I am fortunate enough that my parents don't have that mindset and they encourage me to study whatever I want as long as it is something I am passionate about. I personally value my education and I am extremely grateful to have the opportunity to study what I love at San Francisco State because I know many people who although they might want to attend college do not have the resources or support to do so."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,622,"My values inherited through my family have helped me in many ways throughout my college career. Some of these ways which include responsibility, accountability, and academic honesty. A way that I portray responsibility in my academic setting is by knowing when assignments are due and making a calendar to prioritize what class work I have to do. By doing this is ensures that I am taking responsibility in completing my assignments. In regards to accountability, this trait is reflected in my will to get my assignments done and when I do not complete them, I know the consequences in which I may face. The most important trait that I have inherited is academic honesty. I see this as the most important trait because this correlates highly with my personal morals. This situation can be translated into an issue that I may face day to day. For example if I happen to not finish an assignment I would not allow myself to copy from another peer because it is not fair to my own learning and to the rest of the class that the learning outcome is so low. It can also be seen as me cheating my personal self due to the necessity of the knowledge for future uses."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,607,"The values of my family have tremendously helped me get through college (this is my last semester of undergrad). My mom has taught me the value of having an education and that it is a very important tool to have a brighter future. She always told me since I was a child to make sure I do well at school because I am capable to do so. My mom is the most hardworking person I know and she inspires me to give 110% in everything that I do. Having an education is a huge value in my family, and I will definitely express that in my own family one day. I am lucky to have such a supportive group of people around me during this pivotal point in my life. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,611,"How the values of my family helped me navigate through college is that they taught me how to value my education. As I'm a first generation college student in my family to go to college. My parents believe that it is important to go to college as they want to have a  long-term financial gain, job stability, career satisfaction and success outside of the workplace. This is due to more occupations requiring college degree which is critical to your success in today's workforce. Another thing is that my reason for going to college is not only for my career path. but to repay my parents. As my parents work long hours just to feed and cloth me. When I was younger, we didn't have much. Since we didn't have much it cause me to appreciated higher education. For that reason the values of my family helped me to navigate through college."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,615,"My parents has always enforced me to go to college ever since I was a little girl since they were immigrants and did not have the same opportunities in this country like I do. When it came to my senior year around May when I had to finally choose the college I was going to attend Fall 2018, I told them I'm going to San Francisco State. At first, they didn't like the idea that I was going to school so far from home and wanted me to go to a closer university but eventually they accepted it and decided to support me through it. To this day, they feel proud to say that their first daughter is in college and still continuing. I'm putting in my part and doing this to make them happy and setting a good example for my little sister who is soon to be applying to colleges as well. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,624,"Well I am a first-generation college student so I couldn't go to siblings for help, my community is mostly made up of people who work very blue-collar jobs so they cant exactly help me in things directly school-related. Although my family and those around me don't hesitate to help me in other aspects of my college life like the kind of person I am. For example, my family's strong work ethic and appreciation for sacrifice is what push me along to navigate college. It is like a drive that navigated my attitude and presence in college. like it sets me in a go-getter attitude and hunger for more learning, so one day I can help those who helped me. I may not be the most well equipped but ill be damned if Ill let that stop me and let myself get in my own way."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,117,"Knowing that I have family that supports me is a huge part of why I'm continuing college. The main values I've gotten from my family are mainly stoicism, determination, and to always work hard. I suppose those values come from my community as well, which have been instilled in me since a young age. I would also say that independence is a value that I have been taught, but I don't necessarily reflect that value in all aspects of my life. In school, for example, I sometimes find it difficult to ask for help because I'm used to do things on my own and at times, it can seem like weakness. In this way, independence can be both a good and bad thing, I suppose. Kindness and helping others are also important values to me because I find that the world always needs more compassion."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,606,"I would say the value of my family helped me through the years at college. My family never forced me into a major they thought fit the best for my future, and I feel very appreciated for that. Although they did recommend which major would be the safest route to go to. I've always listened to my family's input, and every single college decision I had to make, I would think of what they said first and how it either helps me or not. But I am very grateful for them to allow me to stay in the house while I go through college and support me through every day. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,612,"The values of my family have never really helped me throughout my college career. My parents in the first place were against me from ever going to college. I actually got into my dream school at UC Davis but my financial aid wouldn't cover enough of my tuition. So, the only way I could at least have the opportunity to go to a university was to convince my parents to let me go to SFSU. I had no help going into what most people call the ""start of the adult"" world. My parents are very traditional people and they have always been supportive except when it came to anything being against their values or their way of thinking. I have since been trying to make them proud and prove to them that going to a university was the best choice for me. I guess the only family values that have guided me through college would be being a hard worker pays off in the future. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,576,"My family values that I have grown up with are to work hard, dream big, never stop learning, always give back and never give up.The way I was raised is also a very big part of my values, I was told you can truly achieve anything if you put everything you got into it nothing is unachievable. These are values instilled in me since birth that have helped me prepare for college. I have such a supportive, loving and committed family. We love each other unconditionally, we are always there for one another. We have travelled the world together and have been through every up and down in life together. I know they will always be there for me to encourage  and support me. As far as my community, I grew up in San Diego where I went to the same elementary, middle and high school with all of my friends. My Clairemont roots in San Diego gives me a sense of obligation to lead and be a positive role model and to help build and guide my city into the future ahead. I value and treasure my relationships with my family, friends and community. They are my building blocks of love, growth and blessed to call my heart and home."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,609,"Being a minority first generation college student, I must constantly remind myself that I am able to navigate through college. I am a Mexican with Aztec roots, math and science runs in my blood. Knowing that I come from an incredibly intelligent lineage, I remind myself that if my ancestors could do it then so can I. My dad was valedictorian of his graduating class at his private school in Mexico, he was always a giant math and science fan. I remember the respect he held for our Aztec ancestors, always emphasizing their talent in math. I’d like to think this is where I was inspired to pursue science since my dad make me feel like it was a doable goal due to our lineage. I believe that my honor and respect of my ancestors is a huge factor on my academic performance confidence. If I didn’t have that kind of encouragement, my anxiety would have been too overwhelming for me to get out of my comfort zone and navigate through college."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,614,"My family heavily values education. My parents completed high school but didn’t attend college—as my mom got pregnant with my brother, put family and work first, then immigrated to the United States 4 years later. When my brother grew up, they wanted him to have a good education, however this was difficult since the area they lived in doesn’t have the best of schools as the population is/was mostly poorer Hispanic people. Some early memories I have were from when I would go to the library with my mom to check out books and read some in Spanish, as to practice my bilingualism. Throughout my educational career, my parents made it very known to me that my schoolwork and educational success is important. Knowing all of this reminds me that today in college, I am supported by my family, and will do my best to be successful in college so that I can achieve the future that I want. I know this would make my parents proud as my education and fulfillment is something they’ve seen as a priority for my whole life, and have made sacrifices to do so. Being a first-gen student and coming from a city that wasn’t full of resources helps me value the opportunities that an institution like SF State, can give."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,613,"I'm a first-generation student. My family is from Mexico, and both of my parents never had the opportunity to study because they had to work. I feel like they're always pushing me into finishing school because they don't want me to be In their situation. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,619,"For this essay on how the values of my community and family helped me navigate through college I think there are a lot of factors. First of all, I was born in Argentina and moved to the United States when I was 16; that means my first language is Spanish and also my culture and values are also from Argentina. Since I was very young, my family valued traveling and being open minded a lot. Argentina is a very closed minded and religious country, which is why they thought traveling would help me with this while growing up. When I was 12 I moved to Hong Kong for a a year and went to an Australian School, helping me with my english and also teaching me not only the Chinese culture, but also Australian. Later on, I moved to Spain. Even though Argentina was owned by Spain, they are two very different cultures and I got to learn more about the Spanish one. Lastly, I moved to the United States when I was 16 and learned more about this culture. Traveling since young and moving around countries have helped with being open minded, but also helped me adapt easily to new scenarios. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,616,"Silverio Flores-Garcia SCI 215Reflective Essay #3My values in the community are simply to respect others regardless of their age and to help one another because that's all that we have is each other. My family consists of 5 brothers and my parents. So in total we are a family of 7. I owe it up to my family to pursue a higher education. I want to be able to bring a diploma home from the university and pursue my dream career cause I want to make my family happy as well as my community. My dad had nothing growing up in his childhood and my parents both struggled with money and finding the best education for me. They managed to succeed and now I have won awards from grade school all the way through college. I even had my three years of community college paid for and books as well. So my motivation and my family pride is really high because I can't let them down no matter what. I have come so far as a child and as an educator, researcher and a pursuer for a higher education. I'm almost done. I have two years left and I will stop at nothing to complete my undergrad and then pursue a higher education such as med school  and or graduate school. My goal is to become a physician in emergency medicine.I want to be able to give back to the community in improving the well being/health of the community. I know that the rise for a medical profession is at an all time high. So I am more pressured and motivated to finish."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,620,"My values have gotten me through college because my family preaches perseverance and striving for what you want in life no matter how hard the challenge might be. Sure, it might come with a lot of ups and downs more times than other challenges, but in the end it will pay off in a big way. Being a part of a family full of doctors, it would be fitting if I was to become one also, right? Not to just fit in my family, but my desire to become one is very strong due to the fact that the attitude of doctors seems to be positive for the most part, and it makes me feel that they feel a sense of relief after working so hard to achieve what they’ve wanted in a long time. I want to feel that sense of relief, and to live off the rest of my life as one that I can look on as being a hardworking life, while at the same time seeming like an easygoing one."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,617,"My family moved from India in a young age so they could give their children a better life. They have made a lot of sacrifices, worked really, and encouraged me to do well in school. Which is why I also work hard, and take that courage to do well in school. I think its important for me to be successful in life so I can also provide a good future for my children. But, sometimes its hard because I constantly feel like I'm working and sometimes I feel unmotivated and tired to do even some of the simple tasks. But, on days when I am going through a slum I remind myself of my worth, my success's, and imagine myself of what I have looking forward too at the end of the road. My hard times will lead to better days. Which is why I make sure to always try my best in everything I do."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,618,"So I come from a very small town in the middle of nowhere. I am from the “Salad Bowl of the World” where all the field workers are. I myself have even worked in a factory packing broccoli. I guess coming from a small town into the city has made me a little more humble. I definitely appreciate the small things more than most because I know how hard life can get. I have the support from many of the community members back home since everyone knows everyone and especially since my mom’s been doing everyone’s hair for about 30 years now. Everytime i come back home, it’s a reminder of why I left in the first place, which was to get an education and make a better life for myself and my family."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,621,The values of my community and family have definitely helped me navigate through college. My family has always made sure we understand that education is a privilege and we should always make sure that it's the most important thing. Especially being a first generation Latina in college it is always important to remember the values taught by my family. My mom always told us that our only responsibility is to go to school and do more with our lives. I come from a family of immigrants and so striving hard for my career has always been a big goal. I have always wanted to be in a big field because that I know I will be successful in. I chose to study in medicine because I want to make my family proud but also want to do it for myself because I love medicine and I feel like it will fulfill my life. Throughout my entire academic career I have always known that the end goal is college and grad school because my biggest responsibility is and will always be my education. I am a first generation college student and have always wanted to make my family proud and I know the best way to do that is to make sure that I finish my studies and give just a little bit back of everything my mom has done for me. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,623,"Neither of my parents finished college and that had all the influence on me wanting to actually finish and accomplish what they didn't. They have always encouraged me and my siblings to do better in life than they had and wanted us all to get an education and stable careers. I am a middle child so I got to experience my older sister go through college first which also had a big impact on me. Her journey was long and kind of all over the place, not taking it seriously or knowing what she wanted to do for years. She moved schools a bunch because she wanted to live in different places and wasn't focused and was in college for 8 years. She always regretted that she didn't just get it done earlier and wanted to be done with it and I learned a lot from that. I certainly didn't want to be in college for longer than I had to so I chose something that I thought best suited me to study and I decided to stay focused on achieving my goal of graduating and eventually going on to grad school. "
