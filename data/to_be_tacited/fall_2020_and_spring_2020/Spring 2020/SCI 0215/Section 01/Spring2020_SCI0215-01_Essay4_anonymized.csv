2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,623,"I think online learning has both benefits and drawbacks. I have a lot more time to work on school and my assignments which is great because I had a lot going on before everything shut down and almost no time to even do homework or study. Now I have all the time in the world but it's hard to actually dedicate the time to get things done. I am trying to find a better balance between school and self-care now and I feel like I am actually starting to figure it out. At the beginning I was prioritizing self-care and now I am doing better in school. There are still days where I completely forget about zoom meetings though, mostly because I don't know what day it is. I definitely still liked meeting in person more than this online format. I think it was more conducive to my learning because it was more interactive and convenient. I also felt like I was being held accountable for showing up to class in person, taking tests in person, turning in assignments, etc. It was just a better environment for me so I hope we can return soon enough. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,619,"Online classes have impacted my learning a lot actually. It is really hard for me to do things online, specially try to learn material. Since I was really young I always preferred reading books with the physical copy instead of online, so this makes it really hard. Not only is it harder for me to focus because with my laptop I have more distractions, but it also makes it easier to not learn and just memorize the information. The other thing is that many professors are not making it easier to learn online. First of all, as a stem major is already hard to take some classes even in person which is why they tell you to not take them online or even during summer. Now, taking it online during a pandemic is even harder because it gives more stress, at least for me. Some professors are being really understanding which is amazing, and try to give extra opportunities to make the grade better, but some are making it even harder and being stricter because ""we are supposed to have more time"" which is not always the case, for example for me. I started working even more because now I have to and even had to move as well as many people so everything just adds on to the stress. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,618,"The switch to online classes has hit me really hard. I cannot focus when I need to do assignments on the computer. I am more of a hands-on learner and being in front of a screen all day is not cutting it for me. I also do not have a job at the moment so I am living off of my savings, tax returns, and the stimulus check I got later than everyone else. I temporarily moved back to my mom’s house to help her out and pay for some bills which had kept me busy and the internet out here in the middle of nowhere isn’t helping either. The only good thing to come out of this quarantine is that I have spent more time with my family, even if we are arguing all the time, and have really helped them out around the house. The concerns I have about my learning is if I will be able to get all my work done before the semester is over because my attention span is really short here at home. As for my well being, I think I’ll be ok."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,610,"I think the most challenging part of online classes is finding the motivation to do them. I commuted to school for almost 5 hours round trip so when I was on campus I would think to myself I came all this way I better learn something, now that it is right there easily available to me I find myself not willing to put forward the same energy as before. I have worked on this by setting schedules for myself to work on my homework and attend lectures, I would say things have gotten a lot better. I don't think I am getting the same learning experience I would've had going to campus because labs are online, we don't get to do things online. It feels like we are only completing lab reports to get the credit not to actually understand what is going and learn. That is my biggest concern for my learning because as I move up to different courses, I fear that I will not know everything I need to because we might have skipped over it during the semester. I also understand that it is not only difficult for us students but also for professors, it is challenging finding the balance between giving us time to deal with the pandemic and continuing with lectures as schedule to stay on track for the semester. For self-care I guess I am just sleeping more, I still go to work everyday and commute but not as often when I had to go to school and work. Hope you are taking care of yourself and staying safe! :)"
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,612,"Online classes have hit me like when a truck hits a wall.I find it extremely difficult to become motivated to learn as well as find a routine. I have been going to sleep around 2-3 in the morning and sleeping in through my morning zoom lectures. I think overall, its been really rough to try to learn in a non-learning environment. I have taken some online classes before, but being a stem major, classes like chemistry or labs are NOT meant to be taught online. All of my professors except one have all been extremely understanding and very helpful during such a difficult time that we are all going through. Even though online classes have been hard, in a way, I force myself to try to learn and it has actually been helpful trying to learn by myself even though no student should ever have to go through this.My mental health has definitely been through a whirlwind I have gotten a lot closer to my family in good ways and in bad ways, but overall I am grateful that we are all healthy with a roof on top of our heads and food on our plates. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,616,"Silverio Flores-GarciaSCI-215Reflection Assignment Essay #4Since we had to switch to online zoom classes it has taken a huge toll on my sleep schedule and the workload schedule. At this point, teachers are scrambling to find alternatives by changing dates and applying things we haven’t covered in lectures into quizzes and tests. The various steps that I take when it comes to self-care practices are constantly drinking water. Taking breaks from the computer screen, trying not to look at the news due to the pandemic. Also following up on the lectures online and emailing teachers when it comes to any questions about any material that is tricky. I currently do pushups and situps for exercise, meanwhile, all gyms are closed. It’s difficult to keep up with a plan when everything can pop up as a spontaneous task to complete in a small window of time. I try to accommodate with google calendar and set up events and ideas so that I stay on top of my assignments. I think it’s very essential to have family communicate through zoom and as well as friends. I’m thankful that class is very thorough and follows through with all assignments and explanations with all the questions given to us. I’m thankful that you guys both give mass amounts of time into every lecture on Fridays."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,620,"Online learning has definitely affected my learning, but mostly in a negative way. I find it hard to pay attention due to the various distractions around me, and I’m not used to being able to focus very hard when I’m in my room, just only doing homework. It has made me a little lazy to complete the work that the class has given us, but nonetheless I still find a way to do them because I know that my grade is high priority and I can’t give that up. For self-care, I like to meditate and lay down in my bed and think about what I’m going to be doing to better myself throughout the course of the semester. Being with my parents has definitely helped with my mental state during this time, but they can also be a little distracting when it comes to learning topics. At first, I was happy that this quarantine happened because my schoolwork has gone down and become easier, but was it really worth the cost? I’m still not sure about that at the moment."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,617,"They have impacted my learning because sometimes it’s hard to concentrate since I am not home and there are a lot of different factors around me which are distracting but I am trying to use my desk to more so I don't get lazy. I also sometimes feel unmotivated and I am not learning as much but watching YouTube videos on the topics I am confused about really does help. Also having group chats with other people in my class is helpful because we can do homework assignments together and also help with the course material. For self-care I am making a cup of tea so I could stay concentrated, watching YouTube, and also doing some baking to relive my stress. For my learning I am worried about making sure I pass all my classes because finals are coming soon and I am getting stressed about how I am going to learn all the material so I could take the test. I am also worried how my mental health is going to deteriorate by staying home all day and my parents as worried about going out so hopefully I get to go out and get some fresh air. I also hope classes aren’t online in the Fall.  "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,622,"Online classes have made a huge impact on my academic career this semester. In many ways it has made a lot of my classes more difficult, whether or not it may be due to the accessibility, work ethic, and my home life. Since the beginning of this quarantine, as crazy as it sounds I haven’t had anytime to do anything for self-care. I am constantly trying to do school work when I can and the only time I have available to myself is in the night when everyone else in my home is sleeping. Despite the circumstances I would like to implement a schedule for myself to make sure that I have a healthy lifestyle during this quarantine. As of right now it is very easy for me to lose track of time and forget about assignments, but I have put more effort into fixing this situation by investing in a calendar and planner. Some concerns that I have for myself for the end of this semester and the fall semester is that I will fall further behind on classes due to the accessibility of school materials and setting. Another concern that I have for my education is running myself into the ground by constantly trying to learn through a format that isn't fit for my style."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,613,"I feel like changing to online school has made lazier, and it encourages you to Cheat on an exam which is not acceptable. It has also changed my sleeping schedule since I used to commute. It was hard to hear that gyms got closed because I'm a pretty active guy, but thankfully I have some dumbbells at the house and I'm able to workout. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,624,"Ahh man what is there not to say the first weeks were rough. Obviously getting thrown out of your element and routine that has been stable for the 3 years I have been commuting to campus did shake me up. Prior to the shelter in place, I only have taken one online class which was art history and that class I took for a GE requirement that was easy, but more importantly, I had a deep interest. That class also didn't prove to be a challenge which is what most of the science classes especially chem216 is proving to be. so now in all online classes poses the question of can I stay motivated and focused enough. I bring its own challenges, but I have slowly started and am continuing to make a routine to counteract this laziness and procrastination that plagues online classes. For one my sleep schedule was a little out of whack but now I am trying to sleep at 10 the latest, give or take an hour and a half for leeway to set myself a little better. To combat the distraction aspect of online classes I designated my desk as strictly a productive zone and for serious business LOL. Just so I can tell myself that if I get something done at my desk that it will motivate me to continue. For wellness I took up running, not only because of healthy body/nutrition means a healthy mind, but I found myself with an added amount of energy because I'm not going class to class like I used to. So it tires me out some and I can relax and not be all anxious plus the long runs clear my mind like a lil reset :). Lastly for wellness, I find myself with some more free time and I chose to focus that into art right now I just got back into sketching so I have been sketching life drawings. I only sketch when I know it's not going to stress me out and will enjoy all the growing pain taking up a hobie includes. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,607,"Online classes have impacted my learning in such a drastic way. I think that I'm learning how to manage my time better because it has been really easy to just take naps and do nothing. I still have to attend zoom meetings for my classes at the same scheduled time, which makes it better because it's just like how it was before. Having STEM classes is not easy in this online format, but at the same time, I am thinking positively. Before the quarantine, I never did homework at home, I was always at the library 24/7. I usually get distracted at home, but I am adapting to it. Some self-care things that I'm doing is FaceTiming my friends, watching Netflix, and cooking (making my own meals is so satisfying to me). I'm getting back to cooking and baking again, which I love because I actually have time to do those things. I hope that everything else is doing well too because this is a stressful time as a student."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,605,"The transition to online learning isn’t all that new to me so it was fairly easy. The only issue was that my laptop died on me and I'm not in the situation to get another one right now, so doing homework for chemistry has been fairly difficult. I suppose later one I’ll see the negative aspects of learning and analyzing labs based on other people's data but until then it’s been pretty smooth. I’m actually really worried about my chem class because I haven't been doing the homework because I've been smoked with other teachers' work that I forgot that Aleks had specific assignment dates, which I know will greatly affect my overall grade. For self-care I’ve been working out to relieve a lot of the stress and negative thoughts that I’ve been dealing with, basically throwing myself into physical stress to block out the mental strain. The only concern that I have for my well-being is that one day I'll have a complete mental break from the stress and pressure I put on myself."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,405,"I finally get to write down what I have been doing and feeling during the lockdown for an alma journal. When we transferred from physical instruction to online instruction, I was really worried at what would happen with my motivation and productivity for the remainder of the semester since I never took an online class before and going to school helps me feel productive. I was a bit disheartened knowing that my schedule that I established for this semester was disruptedIt was a bit difficult finding a good pace for my online classes once they started as not all of my classes were prepared for the change and I had to deal with moving back home from my on-campus housing. My physics class for example was not prepared for the change and I know it took a while for communication to improve as we went more into the semester. Despite this initial feeling, I feel like I have been going through an uphill battle with my homework since I was a bit behind on some assignments last week, but I feel like I have been catching up lately. I was anxious in finishing up schoolwork at home since I know in the past I have an issue with getting distracted with lying in bed a lot at home which is why I try to do my homework outside of home. I'm glad I have been improving with my self-discipline in regards to time-managing work on my schoolwork at home.  For self-care, I have been trying to get adequate sleep, taking naps, eating ok, trying to exercise a little bit inside my house, going outside to get some fresh air, chatting with friends and family, taking breaks by watching Youtube or browsing social media, and lying in my bed. Nothing out of the ordinary from what I've been doing before the quarantine. I feel like I've been handling the quarantine a bit better than some since I'm used to staying inside a lot when we were able to go outside frequently; being an introvert-extrovert in this time is an advantage compared to being just an extrovert. I hope others have been doing okay too though."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,611,"I feel that online classes has made my classes much more easier than before. That because when we take an exam or quiz online we can always just go on google and search for the answer. Online classes for me just make me less motivated to study for classes as I can always find most of the answers online and it make me procrastinate more. Online classes just make me to be more lazier. I also feel that it make much harder to talk to my classmates because online meetings especially in zoom when we are in our break room we don't show our face but only our mic is on. It make me feel that I'm just talking to computer and the actual person behind the screen. It just hard. For my self-care, I usually try to go on an 1-hour walk through my neighborhood to help clear my mind and just to relax. Another thing I do for my self care is that I'm cooking more than before. This is because I have more time on my hand and cooking just help me to de-stress. I have learn so many recipes over the course of this stay in place."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,615,"The transition to online classes has been a weird turn for me because I definitely feel very unmotivated. It makes me very lazy and easy to put in half effort then I normally would at school. Being at school actually makes me more motivated and on top of my work but now that its remote learning I don't really care about my classes when I really should be since it matters. At first, I would forget to wake up for this sci class and would sleep through the whole thing, but now I set my alarm so that I'm present for it. Since I came back home ever since the quarantine lockdown, I get easily distracted by my family. I love them so much but I can't seem to focus in the presence of them. In terms of self-care, I definitely have been catching up on all the sleep in the world, its my favorite thing to do lol. Also, I try to keep myself distracted by going on occasional walks or drives. I also try to do skin care routines or do home workouts, even clean more than I usually would. I've also catched up on many tv shows on Netflix, Hulu, or Disney plus. Also, since I get stressed out due to many deadlines from all my different classes, I still set up a plan on my calendar  when to finish all the assignments."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,621,Honestly online classes has probably been one of the worst transitions I’ve had to do in college. I understand it’s hard for every major but from personal experience I think it’s especially hard for STEM majors. I don’t exactly know how I am going to be able to pass classes that are meant to be in person online and how exactly I am going to be able to retain as much information. I miss the library and I miss the classroom environment. I don’t take online classes for a reason. I am the kind of learner who needs to do things over and over in order to get it but being online it’s a lot harder to do so. I am extremely sad that fall will most likely continue online and have it cut into my college experience. I don’t want to keep doing online anymore but I am extremely grateful for the few professors I’ve had that are actually understanding. I just hope this will all be over soon and that we will be back in our classroom settings. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,609,"Online classes have had an impact on my mental wellbeing since without going to school I’m stuck being alone in my apartment 8 hours away from my family. I struggle with anxiety, and physically being in an academic setting helps me out from freaking out if I’m struggling with schoolwork. I loved going to my research lab to work on homework because of the productive vibe. I liked being around encouraging and inspiring people since it helped motivate me.   For self-care I still do my weekly pampering routine where I do face masks and give myself a pedicure. I worked at Sephora, so I do feel grateful for still being able to be stocked up on these luxury products.   I also like to play videogames during the evenings and weekends, I just finished Adventure Time: Pirates of the Enchiridion. I love the calming soundtrack from the candy kingdom. Another selfcare tactic I am doing is water coloring again since I haven’t worked on any art in years now.   The only concern I have for my classes is actually chemistry class. I feel like I wasn’t able to be as comfortable in this class as I hoped, and I fear it’ll only be a domino effect where I will struggle in my future chemistry classes(since I still do want to minor in chemistry). I’m going to see where I stand after my grades for this last test and debate on retaking CHEM 215 over summer. I already signed up for Organic Chemistry for the fall, and I don’t want to push that class another semester back."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,614,"Having online classes instead of physical classes has been difficult, like many students would agree. I enjoy learning and going to class, but now that I don't have a class to go to, I feel like I'm not learning and so I'm less motivated. I miss feeling eager when doing my experiments during chemistry lab. I get distracted easily-- and having to do work at home makes it more difficult to stay on topic. Because of this, I usually would go to the library to work on Aleks or homework. But now that the library is closed, I need to do my homework in my room which is difficult since I need to have a lot of space where I can spread my work out.  It sucks having to teach yourself content, while knowing that tuition is being paid for an online service. I have never felt this way before, but education doesn't feel concrete. Self care has been difficult because there are a lot of stresses that have happened in my life. I try to rest well and go out on walks to clear my mind. I find I take more hot showers to relax myself. I'll also listen to music and dance when I feel stressed, as well.I'm concerned I will not learn effectively, be less motivated in school, and will be unable to be passionate about what I want to study"
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,576,"To be completely honest campus closure is killing me. There is a very high level of stress going on this semester, From dealing with negative press constantly shoved down our throat that we are indirectly forced to watch to stay informed and updated. Educational stress of moving to an online format when all my classes  are STEM related courses and I am very much a Kinesthetic learner or hands on learner. Having to vacate campus last minute and leave SFSU is an overwhelming stress. I went from having my own place and room with ability to find a quite environment of study to sleeping on my parents couch. Financially as well this time is very stressful, we had 5 sources of income coming in before the virus started to take effect on the economy. Everyone in my immediate family was working and bringing in cash flow now there is only 1 member in my family working and bring in revenue during this time of struggle. This is only a fractional contribution to my current surface level of stress I have been dealing with. I am not really doing any additional self care outside my regular routine. Some recommendations of self care would be amazing. The biggest concern of mine is my grade then my knowledge of the subject."
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,606,"I do not like online classes to begin with. I think not being able to study in an environment where you're supposed to study and learn with the professor is the most effective way for me to learn. Being at home introduces a lot of distraction because being at home is a place of relaxation and not really a study area. But I am doing my best to keep my head in the book to be on track, even though it is a lot harder now for me to learn, especially lab classes. Not being able to do lab work is almost impossible for me to learn because I'm not there doing the actual experiments. However, since I am mostly at home now, there are other things that I've learned like solving a rubrics cube and other hobbies. I am also exercising a lot more now than before and it's helping my well being and keeps me healthy. I'm also watching what I eat more as well. There are pros and cons during this pandemic, but hopefully, this semester will end because it's my last semester and hopefully will be done with online classes soon. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0215,SI,1,117,"The transition to online classes has had a negative impact on my learning. I've taken one online course before and I have to admit that I paid minimal attention to the lectures. My motivation and productiveness has gone down by a sizable amount since then. However, I still want to achieve good grades so I will force myself to complete the assignments on time and try to do well on the exams. For the most part, I do pay attention to courses that do live Zoom, but for those with pre-recorded lectures, I find it challenging to stay engaged and watch them in the first place. I do have an app that reminds me of when I have class or assignments due so that I am at least somewhat organized. For self-care, I have started watching workout videos on Youtube and am attempting to do some semblance of exercise in the mornings to get in shape. I am able to spend a lot more time with my cats now that I am stuck at home. I am mostly concerned that remote learning will continue on until the Fall semester and possibly beyond. "
