2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,688,"When life gets challenging I tend to hone in and work harder than before. I like to think that I work well under pressure but sometimes it gets to me and I get stressed and frustrated. I know that it will not always be easy and I tend to prepare myself for the hard times that lay ahead of me but you don’t always know what is around the next corner. When life gets challenging, I like to sit back and figure out a plan of action. In doing this, I get more organized and the things that need to get done seem like less of a struggle because I have a direct plan that I can follow and check off bit by bit. It takes what seems like chaos and turns it into a plan, even if that plan itself still seems challenging. In my experience you just have to take it day by day and do what you can to stay on top of it and stay on course so that you can get done what you need to get done. It is also important not to overwork yourself because that can be just as damaging as not doing anything at all."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,691,"Alexis BanuelosSCI 230         What I do when life get challenging is usually just remember the people in my life who love me and can support me through these tough times. During this scary time that has everyone in a panicked frenzy, it could be hard to remember that things will get better but the way I'm currently dealing with this situation is really grounding myself and watching lots of movies because it distracts me from the news. Its a super scary time but being around the people I love (especially my dog) has proven to help me cope with the anxiety that comes with bad times like the one we're all facing now. I know a lot of people don't have the same ""support system"" that I may have so when I'm going through bad times I like to remember that I am very lucky to have all that I have and that also helps me really ground myself and realize how lucky and blessed I am in comparison to all the children/adults that don't have anyone. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,692,"When life gets challenging I usually try to isolate the things that are in my control versus the things that are not in my control. For the things within my control, the only thing that gives me peace of mind is by giving it as much effort as I can and rest assured knowing that at least I know I am trying my best. This is generally easier said than done, but by constantly reminding myself that shit happens, and that I can always try harder next time, I can eventually start to feel better about where I am at. For the things that are outside of my control, the only things that seem to help me is by constantly reminding myself that they are out of my control and that there is nothing I can do. The only thing I can do for those is try my best to be a good person and treat everyone around me with respect unless they give me a reason not to. Other than that, having a spiritual connection, whether its with a higher power or within myself via meditation, is especially helpful in dealing with the issues outside of my control. I also found that having healthy creative outlets, like in my case making music and writing poetry or writing in general, have been especially helpful in reflecting on these uncontrollable issues and processing emotions. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,690,When life gets challenging I turn to my family. I am the youngest of four so when things get difficult I ask my family for help because i feel that they faced enough things in their lives that they can give good advice. My parents are more of the ones who comfort me when I need it and my older siblings are the ones who help  me work out my problems. There are times when they can't help me so I have to figure things out on my own. When this happens I try to take things one step a a time. I have to do this or I'll get overwhelmed and not know how to help myself.
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,693,"When life gets challenging, I reflect on what I have to do to fix it. My mind is constantly running on what would be the best solution for this specific problem. Scenarios play through my mind on possible reenactments of solutions, but usually I concluded with 3 options and needing to communicate and ask for advice on choosing the best one. I always want to make the most mature and professional decision to make which is now making me realize the seriousness I have when I have to overcome an obstacle. In the past I would act like a seesaw, gathering up the courage to do something or say something, but my low self-confidence would end up winning. Now, although not easy, my though process is more hyper-aware of my surroundings, options and need for communication to help me get where I want to. I think it is very important to incorporate a balance between reflection, feeling your emotions and taking action, a large part of my loves to psychoanalyze myself, maybe I should have become a psychology major instead of biology. Just kidding, I love cells and the human body."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,686,"When life gets challenging, I first cry to let out all of my frustration and emotions I am feeling at that moment. Then, I do some self care in order to calm down and improve my mental health. My self care consists of listening to my favorite music, taking a long shower, skincare, watching youtube or movies, etc. My favorite music consists of Ariana Grande, Khalid, Halsey, BTS, Lauv, Kehlani, etc. After listening to uplifting music, I tend to be in a better mood because jamming out to music helps me forget why my life is challenging for the time being. Taking a long shower and doing my skincare routine also relaxes me and calms my nerves down after a lot of crying. Lastly, watching youtube or movies can also help me take my mind off of thinking about the challenges in my life. Overall, I usually take these exact steps after I am done crying about my life challenges and feel much better afterwards."
