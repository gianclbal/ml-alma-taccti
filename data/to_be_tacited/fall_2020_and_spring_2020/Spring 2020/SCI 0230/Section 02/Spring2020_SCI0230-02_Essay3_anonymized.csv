I always knew I never wanted a life like that and my uncle went to college and aunt my aunt always told me about her college life from friends to traveling and sorority and her learning stuff and I always knew I wanted a life like that.

2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,693,"My family values have taught me that if there is something I truly feel passionate about I should not be afraid to attain something that makes me feel happy. Being a Chicana from a low-income community can seem overwhelming, and sometimes it is, but there is a wonderful beauty in seeing your ethnic culture blend in a place distinct from your parents. College made me realize how beneficial it is to be different and ethnically proud when I was initially embarrassed to stand out in the slightest. When attending school I keep my values and desires close to my heart to not forget my purpose especially when it is so easy to forget who you are at college. I am very grateful to my parents for having fought for a better future for my sister and I. I do my best academically and at the same time remember to not get caught up in the academic portion of college because I am still young and want to enjoy being young while I can. I guess this is sort of an existential crisis, to have the future I want but simultaneously enjoy time with friends and learn more about the city and what it means to be young and alive. I am creating a foundation for my career while learning to be myself and that is the wonderful thing about life. If I care about something I will give it my 110% because I know that in the end it will pay off, which is the main value that has guided me throughout education."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,686,"My values of community and family has helped me navigate through college by giving me motivation and support. My family means a lot to me because I wouldn’t have been able to go to university if it wasn’t for their sacrifices. My dad immigrated to this country to give his family a better life. As his daughter, I am going to university to not only give myself a better life but to be able to have a stable career where I can support my parents and give back to my community. My community consists of drug abuse and alcoholics, therefore my goal in university is to study biology and become a nurse in the future. By becoming a nurse I will be able to spread awareness of healthy living and care for patients. All in all, I have had to navigate myself through college because I am first generation but with my community's and family’s support, I am able to succeed in my academic career."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,688,"My family is deep rooted in hard work to get the things that you want out of life, and that has inspired me a lot throughout my college career. Even when times get tough and things get uncertain, I have watched my family and the people I look up to never give up but instead just dig deeper and work harder to get to the other side. On top of hard work, a value that I live by everyday is respect. Respect those that deserve it and always be a kind person, regardless of who it is. Respect and hard work have brought my family a long way and are values that I find very important, and I try to hold fast to these values everyday. Sometimes college, and life in general, gets tough. But because I have seen those that I look up to never quit, it has inspired me to never give up and always keep pushing forward and working towards my goals to try and get what I dream about out of this life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,691,"Alexis BanuelosSCI 230      Coming from a community of 95% Hispanics, I grew up seeing people who had to fight their way into this country continue to fight and work so that they could give their children a better life. So I would say that since I grew up in a community like this, I grew up with the mentality that hard work is crucial to make something of myself and make my parents proud. I would say that another thing that helped contribute to me navigate through college was that growing up, my mom made sure to give me chores to do around the house and kind of taught me how to, for lack of better words, ""keep a household"" I feel like because of this, I transitioned very well to living on my own and taking care of whatever comes with that. Most of what I know can be attributed to my parents and family."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,692,"Growing up a muslim in cairo egypt, it has taught me a lot of valuable lessons. I grew up in a completely different world from my peers and it has taught me how much of a blessing it is to be able to even go to college and have the opportunities that I have here in america. It taught me to not take my life here for granted and to be grateful for what I have. I have learned to love the position that I am in, and sometimes I forget why I do what I do. When I think back to how life was back then I am always reminded who I am, where I came from, and what it took for me to be sitting on my laptop in an apartment in san francisco, taking all the classes I need to achieve my dreams. This would have never been possible without my family and they have become this untapped source of motivation for me. They taught me the meaning of taking risks to achieve your goals. "
