Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,686,"Being apart of Sci 230 is beneficial to me because as Bio 230 lectures go very fast and in-depth on difficult concepts, I can ask for help and review the topics I'm struggling on with the instructors in Sci 230. In addition to getting extra help on the Bio 230 course, I'm also able to meet new people and have study groups for exams coming up this semester. Being in the Sci 230 classroom also allows me to work on my biology homework and have it reviewed which in turn helps me save time for other work outside of class. The instructors can help me achieve my goals of passing Bio 230 by motivating me and assisting me with my biology work. Whether that be through reviewing my Bio Journals or going over topics that were taught in class. In conclusion, I am apart of Sci 230 to get the help I need in order to pass Bio 230 and meet new people who are also taking the course."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,687,"Damarcus JohnsonReflection	When I think of why I’m here, my mind goes immediately to my family. I’m here to break that cycle of people not going to college. I’m here doing everything I can to make something of myself. But since coming here, I’ve felt like I’ve grown, but also I have no clue what I want to do in life. I want more than anything to be a surgeon. Maybe the idea of being a surgeon is what I like the most. But unless you’ve grown up poor enough to not be able to buy bread and milk, you may not understand why being a surgeon means so much to me. It means actually making it out. It means being set with a job that I’m highly unlikely to be laid off from. But at times I don’t know.	I feel just lost sometimes. At times the idea of science doesn’t make me happy, but I don’t know if it’s science or just the amount of work. Also, it’s partially my fault. I’m trying to go it alone. So I can say it was all me. Personally the idea of study groups isn’t that appealing to me. I just have my own way of doing things. But it’s whatever. I’ll have to adapt in some way."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,688,"I am here because I want to learn and better myself and my mind. I want to be educated and I want my mind to be valued in a way that demands respect and gives me career opportunities in the future. I love biology and I want to use that love for biology and put it to use helping people, which is why I want to become a doctor. I am in Sci-230 because I needed it to reach full time student status. Not only that but I also want to excel in bio-230 and do the absolute best I can in not just that class but all of my classes. I hope to also network and meet new people because I am new to this school and area and the opportunities that come with networking could be endless. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,689,I am here in this class because I need extra help in the bio class. I want to make sure I am able to actually understand what I am learning well getting a good grade. I feel this class can give me more one on one time with the teachers in the class so they can help me better understand what I don't understand or what I am struggling with.
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,690,I am here because I really want to know if biology is my passion. I have always loved science so my initial connection to this was I wanted to work in a lab. This semester is the first time I am taking a biology course so it would be the perfect opportunity to decide whether I want continue my career in biology or change my major. I also felt that if I surrounded myself with more like minded people I could see how their experience in this field have effected them. If I decide this is what I really want to do I feel like adding this course I could use the extra help. I won't be as stressed trying to find people who could help me study. I can also use this time to do the work I feel is more difficult.
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,691,"Alexis Banuelos Sci 230  Feb 11, 2020            I am in this class because I needed another unit and this was like the perfect class because it would allow me to get the credit and gain a deeper knowledge of Bio 230. When taking bio courses, I heard that it could be hard to not only retain the information but be able to fully grasp the concept of the material due to the fact that so much new information is given to you in short amounts of time. So this class seemed like the best way to balance that. I also am a very hands on/interactive learner and I don’t really get that in the lecture but in this class, I think that I will be able to better understand the material better because of  that. I also really like that it is a super small class and we only meet once a week. Because the size of the class, I don’t feel as embarrassed to ask questions."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,692,"I am here because of a variety of reasons. The initial reason I took this course was because I needed a one unit course to be considered a full time student. I work to pay my rent and go to school, and this class would help balance these two major time constraints on my life especially since it aids in my understanding in Bio 230. My reasoning for taking this class has since been changed. I see the value in networking and getting to know my fellow colleagues. It is also a great course for mastering the information in bio 230. I see the opportunity to give and receive help. Personally I find that thats the best way to learn and truly master a classes concepts. All in all, I am happy with this course as it seems to be here only to help. Thank you! I look forward to spending every Tuesday of this semester in your sci class. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,693,Brenda Garibay2/11/2020      I am here because I am taking the biology course and I want to feel comfortable and supported academically. I have previously taken freshman biology and AP biology my junior year. I know that the SCI courses are meant to be personalize attention and increase the understanding of the material so I am taking advantage of that resource. I do not struggle with science class because I find them very interesting and want to learn as much as I can because I want to follow a career path in scientific research. It is important to me to have a class that wants the students to succeed and ensures that we are all on the same page and understand the content being given. This SCI course will hopefully make me feel comfortable in future science course and perhaps I will gain studying or academic skills I will use in the following years.
