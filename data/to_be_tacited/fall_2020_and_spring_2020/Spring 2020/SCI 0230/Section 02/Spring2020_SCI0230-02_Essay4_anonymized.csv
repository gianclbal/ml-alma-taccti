2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,687,"Damarcus JohnsonA concept that I guess I would like to go more in depth with would be photosynthesis. I guess the question that I would ask would be what would happen if the fires in the Amazon did continue to burn? We know that this area produces a lot of oxygen for people, and it also acts as somewhat of a buffer when it comes to carbon dioxide. So if these trees were burned down how soon would we feel the effects of this? Also if I remember correctly I think that if these trees are burned down they would release all of the carbon dioxide stored in them back into the atmosphere.Truthfully, I haven’t really been keeping up with lectures so there really isn’t anything that I really have burning questions about. None of this really interests me. But what I mentioned above would be somewhat interesting to know about. I do think that if this stuff was burned down it would be much more harmful to us than whatever sort of benefits it would have for farming companies. We’d probably be pretty screwed if it happened. Like I don’t think we’d die, but it would be a very drastic change in life. Something I don’t want to see played out."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,690,"The concept that I feel is the most applicable to people's lives and is beneficial to society DNA and genetics. The fields of microbiology and genetics are two fields that are helping advance research in chronic diseases. Understanding how DNA works and replicates helps us understand how certain we get certain forms of cancer and how some can be passed on. Genetic mutations are the cause of these cancers. For example, loss in the tumor suppressor gene will make you more likely to have abnormal amounts of cell growth. When these cells grow out of control they will begin to form tumors which can become cancerous. There are types of cancers that can be passed down to future generations as well, which is also linked to our genetic makeup. For example, breast cancer can be passed down from mothers to daughters and through many generations."

These plants use the carbon during photosynthesis to create sugars like glucose, so that they could use this glucose during cellular respiration. The left over oxygen is also used in cellular respiration during the electron transport chain, to bind with the spent hydrogens after they go through ATP Synthase. The carbon from Carbon dioxide could be used for a multitude of things and contributes to most of the dry mass in a plant. The carbon could end up being part of a nucleic acid, lipid, protein, or carbohydrate. This information is good for people to know so that they can apply this to things like gardening, and knowing how to take care of a plant. They need the carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to grow and if people use that to their advantage they can yeild healthy plants. Like the seed experiment, the plant needs a combination of these 3 things or else it cannot sprout and grow properly and do its normal functions like photosynthesis and cellular respiration."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,689,I would say something we went over was like the weight of the plant and also how and when photosynthesis or cellular respiration happen and where and what can affect or help. In my lab meeting I was confused and so were other students on it when we had a journal due for lecture about the BTB and photosynthesis and cellular respiration my teacher helped explain it by first breaking down everything and explaining what it was and what it needed to perform its work. Photosynthesis happens in a plant and needs sun water and carbon dioxide but on the other hand cellular respiration happens in an animal and needs different things to go through that process. Then after we understood that we then went into how when BTB affects it and when it combines with photosynthesis or cellular respiration and why it changed color. I understand now how it works also with the weight after doing the self assessment and going over them I started to understand more   Of how a planet gets its mass and the things that do and don’t give it mass. I started to see the mass doesn’t get much of its weight through water or light but it actually gets a lot of weight from carbon dioxide. And this holds most of the weight.
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,686,"What are the different phases of cellular respiration? The purpose of cellular respiration is to transform energy in one glucose molecule to energy in thirty-six ATP. Moreover, cellular respiration provides energy for cells to function. The first phase of cellular respiration is glycolysis and this phase occurs in the cytoplasm. In the glycolysis phase, energy stored in glucose is transferred to pyruvate molecules and energy carrier molecules known as NADH.  The next phase is transition reaction which occurs in the mitochondrion. During the transition reaction phase, energy stored in pyruvate is transferred to acetylCoA and a NADH energy carrier molecule. Then carbon dioxide gas is released within the mitochondrion. The third phase is known as the citric acid cycle or krebs cycle which also occurs in the mitochondrion. In the citric acid cycle, the energy from two acetylCoA’s are transferred to: six NADH, two FADH2, two ATP, and four carbon dioxide. Finally, the last phase of cellular respiration is the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis phase. This phase also occurs in the mitochondria and electrons from NADH and FADH2 provide energy to pump hydrogen ions out of the mitochondrial matrix. In addition, this phase produces the most ATP. In conclusion, all living organisms go through the process of cellular respiration to provide energy for our cells."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,693,"A common concept constantly mentioned in biology is the central dogma process, it feels like I have dreams about it, good dreams of course. Either way I always wondered how the body knew how to preform the central dogma, I mean, we constantly talk about how the central dogma is the holy grail of DNA being transcribed to RNA and then being translated into proteins, but how does the body know exactly when the body is in need or proteins. Perhaps this was not the best question to ask, but I remember in my biology class listening to cell signaling, a concept I did terribly in because there were so many moving parts proteins which contributed to making other proteins. The idea that there are proteins which help make proteins is such a strange and ironic concept, and even more when you realize those proteins simply have their function embedded into them. What if functions could be added to proteins? In the near future, I hope to enter the biotechnology companies and research more about cells or proteins, there is a lot which could be researched. On the topic of the functions of proteins and the central dogma, I learned in a program how there was an enzyme that was engineered to be more efficient in PCR. The most common used enzyme is Taq Polymerase, but now it had a replacement that increased the PCR process with more yield. By engineering proteins, more medications can be developed for communities. One is taught in biology there is only one pathway because it is easier for students to retain information and understand concepts which can overwhelming but little room is made for applying the science learned to serve a greater purpose in communities. One of these greater purposes is engineering pre-existing proteins for increased yield to then incorporate more importantly in communities which are less fortunate on resources for their health. "
