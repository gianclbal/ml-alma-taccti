2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,689,I want to go into my major which is bio because I want to be a orthodontist. I have always wanted to be this ever since I got my braces. it has always just interested me because I like to look at teeth and I enjoy seeing pretty teeth. when I first meet someone I always look at teeth first. also I know for me I hated the way my teeth were and after getting my braces off I was so much more confused and happy and feel so much better about my appearance. I always want to be able to give someone else that opportunity to feel their best self in their own body and be proud to smile.
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,687,"Damarcus JohnsonI wanted to be a doctor so I could save lives. I've lost a lot of loved ones, and it hurt a lot. Enough for me to become an extremely private person with my family. I thought that if I become a surgeon I would be able to maybe help some other family. Give them more time with their loved ones. I wanted to commit myself to some heroic cause. That's what I wanted to do, but it turns out that I was wrong. I've turned to cooking now. I chose my happiness over everything else. I want to be happy. I want to love what I'm doing, and I think I'll always love cooking more than science. Actually that's false, I love them both equally. Cooking is a form of science if you really think about it. So I'm choosing to go to culinary school because I'm trying my best to live a happy life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,688,"i want to go into my major because biology has always been my favorite thing to study and it comes easy to me because I enjoy it so much. anything from microscopic organisms to the giant whales in the ocean, it is all super fascinating to me and I love to learn new things about it. On top of that I want to help people, and I enjoy helping others when I have the ability to do so. This is why I chose physiology. With the major of physiology I can start working towards being a doctor, and help others in need of helping. I'm also jsut extremely interested in the human body. Learning about the human body is like learning about yourself and you get to better understand how your body functions and how to treat it. I love to learn and surround myself with biology because it is my JAM."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,686,"Originally, I wanted to go into pre-nursing as my major however I realized how impacted it was and the chances of becoming an official nursing major is low. Therefore, I applied for a pre-biology major when I was filling out the San Francisco State University application during my senior year of high school. After doing a lot of research of the concentrations in biology, I ended up choosing physiology because that way I can learn most of the things nursing majors are learning. Another reason why I chose biology is because in my opinion it is one of the easier sciences to comprehend. However I still ended up having to take chemistry and physics because of the biology requirements. All in all, after I graduate with a bachelors in biology, I can go on and get my nursing certificate and become a pediatric nurse. I want to have a career in nursing because of my passion to spread a healthy lifestyle in my community. I was inspired by my dad who smokes a lot and my grandparents who are often sick. By majoring in biology and becoming a nurse I can be able to help my family and the people in my community."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,692,My major is Human Physiology. I have always been fascinated by the human body and all of its various systems. The human brain by itself is what I believe to be the single greatest wonder to exist in our universe. We are capable of doing so much with our brains we have accomplished so many great things and evolved to be in the place that we are in as a species. Aside from the human brain the human body is extremely complex. We have the ability to self heal from so many injuries and modern medicine has allowed us to extend our life spans in ways that no other species or entity can. I also have wanted to learn about how to extend our life spans even further and fix many conditions that have affected many many humans from having the quality of life that they deserve. I love the human body. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,691,Alexis BanuelosSCI 230         I would like to go into my major to help people. My major is currently pre biology but I would like to change it to cell and molecular biology and I would like to use that to help with the cure of diseases or just to do lab work. When I first got to sf state I thought that I wanted to be a surgeon but I found a great interest in cells on a molecular level. My knowledge isn't very vast on the subject because I'm just starting out but I'm very interested to find out more about what I can learn and potentially put my knowledge to use. I need to do more research on how I can achieve my goal because I don't know what classes I need to take so I need to speak to an advisor so they could help me with this.        
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,693,"Brenda GaribayReflective Journal #5The reason I want to go into my major, which is biology, is because I want to do lab research in my future and I want to help communities in creating something that will help them. Being a biology major is not easy, in fact there are many classes one must take to graduate as a cellular and molecular biology major. However, I know that with the proper mindset and support systems my pathway will be much smoother and worthwhile. I hope to earn a PhD and become someone who can biologically use existing instructions and combine them in new ways for a distinct purpose to help the world. The process to apply biology to the properties of a cell to innovate and discover is an educational pursuit I have. I know that my community is under-resourced in opportunities for their health for example producing more nutrient filled meals or equipment to test their health is not available to them like in other communities. I specifically like biology courses more than other science course because in biology everything seems to connect to the bigger picture better than other classes."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,2,690,"I want to go into my major because it is something i have always been passionate about and good at. there were always times in school where I struggled with other subjects but biology always came naturally. I found it was what i wanted to do in high school when i went to science camp for twp summers. I got to work with a company called Griffols. I learned how they synthesize proteins to make medicine and I really liked their work. Although, I am not sure I want to work in a lab I enjoyed the aspect of helping people and learning more about how life works. Recently, I have been looking at alternative ways I can apply bio to other studies. My ultimate goal would be to marry psychology and the anatomy of the brain in order to create a more effective therapy to help women and children recover from abuse."
