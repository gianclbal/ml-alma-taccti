2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,681,"I'll go ahead and pick the topic of photosynthesis, a concept that we've been going over for the later part of this semester. Keep in mind that before I took this class I had very little understanding as to how photosynthesis worked and how plants went about growing. Now I can confidently engage in a conversation with any green thumb or biologist out there on the topic of plant growth and photosynthesis. This is relevant to my life right now given the state of the world. As it stands we are all under quarantine and have to spend all of our time within the confines of our houses. This has given me plenty of down time to start up a garden in the yards around my house. It is nice to know how the plants and grass that I am growing functions and how it gets from point A to point B. It is something that should become common knowledge amongst society as I feel it could be beneficial knowing about the biology of plants. Knowing the importance of plants and what they give us in return is key and could potentially motivate some folks to start home gardens, thus increasing the amount of oxygen being expelled into the air and decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere slowly but surely.   "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,348,"I am going to be discussing the Envelope homework and lecture. The reason I chose to do this one was because at first I did not really understand why they wanted us to know it and I did not really know the main points except for the fact that plants need CO2 to go through photosynthesis and produce food/nutrients. So if we were to plant more trees it will help get rid of some carbon dioxide, it captures CO2 and releases oxygen into the atmosphere which helps climate change. However, There are other points to it, yes, climate changes are partially due to increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere. If we plant more trees it will help remove more CO2 from air because trees can accumulate huge amount of biomass by fixing CO2 in the air through photosynthesis. This is something I did not know but makes sense, Trees actually grow faster in elevated CO2 environment, so planting trees  could be a key part of the solution to lower CO2 levels in the air. Planting trees can even have other benefits like help habitate restorations and water reservations and other things of this sort. These are all the main parts to the envelope scenario. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,678,"How is energy transformed?There are millions of different forms energy can take, so let's talk about photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Energy starts out as sunlight energy which is captured by the plants chloroplasts, and in addition to H2O water(from the roots) and CO2 carbon Dioxide(absorbs from the air by the stems or leaves) create C6H1206 glucose sugar and O2 oxygen. It goes through 2 different processes, the light independent reactions and the light dependent reactions. Light dependent reactions turn the sunlight into ADP and NADPH, both forms of energy. That is then used in the light independent reactions to create sugar(product) which then contains the energy which is now converted. In cellular respiration, the opposite happens. Energy starts out as c6H12O2glucose and ATP, which in addition to O2 oxygen create CO2 carbon Dioxide and H20 water. Energy(glucose molecule in this case) goes through first Glycolysis where it creates 2 ATP and 2 pyruvate. The 2 pyruvate then enter the Krebs cycle where it gets turned into 2 more ATP. Then undergoes the electron transport chain where we get 34 ATP, for a total of 38. This is important because for mammals such as us humans, we need cellular respiration to breath and to function. We need plants to photosynthesize because too much CO2 is extremely harmful and we need the O2 that they produce."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,362,"Why is important the transformation of energy in living organisms?  Everything in life has a control and a reason on why things happened. Nothing is left to luck. The chemical reactions are also control; they don’t happen just by its molecular movement, each chemical reaction is controlled by a specific enzyme that helps safe energy.  In living systems every reaction has a purpose.  A way that living organisms prevent from heating is when there are exothermic and endothermic reactions happening at the same time. The energy that is needed by one reaction is provided by the other reaction; This can be done thanks to the enzymes that control these reactions of transformation of energy.   The enzymes are providers of energy within the cells, and important enzyme is the adenosine trisphosphate (ATP), the nicotin-adenin-dinucleotoide (NAD). The ATP works with enzyme that catalase the reactions of transferring the high energy, and the NAD works with enzyme that oxidase organic substances; this is known as oxidation process. The ATP transports and transfers the high energy, and the NAD transfers the hydrogens to a higher level of energy."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,670,"I feel that as kids we're taught the basics of photosynthesis and energy-which is great for helping people understand plants and how they work; and with the ""U-ABC-IT"" method in bio 230 we learn how to think better. But, when photosynthesis goes into more depth with how it connects to cellular respiration and how it is a mechanism for all living things-not just plants, it helps us better understand our place in nature as humans since people so easily lose sight in that we are not that special in comparison to the rest of nature. By practicing thinking questions like the ones we use in bio 230 during lecture it pushes us to use the things we do know to help us figure out what we don't know in a logically approached way, in bio 230 it doesn't help to jump to conclusions but it does help to run through the ideas that we do know and understand with another classmate and come to a good inference. During the photosynthesis/cellular respiration unit we learned that without photosynthesis, cellular respiration would not be able to occur. The sugar made in photosynthesis is required to make the ATP that cellular respiration produces and the water and carbon dioxide that we produce is essential for the cycle to continue. One can not function without the other. This is such familar information but once you study it more closely, it helps us better understand how important nature is to us and where our role is meant to be."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,685,"The topic I chose was photosynthesis. Photosynthesis, a process by which green plants and certain other organisms use the energy of light to convert carbon dioxide and water into simple sugar glucose. Photosynthesis is important to living organisms because it is the number one source of oxygen in the atmosphere. In the process, they produce oxygen, which constitutes a significant portion of the air we breathe so less plants means less recycling of carbon dioxide and less oxygen production. Plants also give us food and fibers to make clothes and without photosynthesis, we would not be able to sustain the life we are living.The importance of photosynthesis in our life is the oxygen it produces. Without photosynthesis there would be little to no oxygen on the planet.  If photosynthesis ceased, there would soon be little food or other organic matter on Earth. Most organisms would disappear, and in time Earth’s atmosphere would become nearly devoid of gaseous oxygen."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,673,Question: what is the original source of all the energy in your body? The original source of all the energy in our body is sunlight.  Sunlight fuels plants to grow and create glucose from co2. We benefit from this by eating these plants along with other animals and inhaling the oxygen exhaled from plants. It’s kind of like the circle of life. Without the sun the plants wouldn’t be able to grown and we’d have no form of oxygen giving it a domino effect. One cannot survive without the other. This could be used to benefit society or people’s lives because if more people thought about this cycle more people might care to put a stop to global warming knowing the significance of Mother Nature to our lives. Without it we’ll parish in the same way it will if we continue to be careless and harm the planet. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,682,"We are learning about water. Water is a compound containing molecules, each of which is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen bonded together. Across a large proportion of the Earth, it's in liquid form, which is convenient because humans need to drink it. Though at the poles it is a solid called ice, it can also evaporate to form water vapor. The water vapor then rises to create clouds, which eventually cause rain. On Earth, water literally falls from the skies. This little fact is something we're so used to that it may seem trivial, but it's a pretty big deal. With this information, we know that water is vital to human biology, and indeed, all biology on Earth. We currently believe that the presence of liquid water is an important requirement for the development of life, to the point that it's the main thing we're searching for in our attempts to find life elsewhere in the solar system. Four main functions of water in our body are that water protects and cushions vital organs, cushions joints, help to convert food into energy, and helps your body absorb nutrients. This information could be beneficial to individuals and a community since it can give them more awareness and maybe see that water is very beneficial for their body not just for the daily chores and that their body will be more healthy and stable. Many would probably drink more water. Also, this could help those that really don't think water is necessary or those that don't like water. It's educational and beneficial."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,677,"Huiping DowDellSci 230Extra Reflection EssayHow is drinking too much water dangerous for athletes?               Drinking too much water can be dangerous for athletes because it can cause hyponatremia . This occurs when sodium concentration in the blood is low. Sodium is an electrolyte, and it helps regulate the amount of water that is in and around the cells of the body. Severe symptoms include confusion, seizures and coma. Cases of hyponatremia can be tested with diluted Urine, which is caused by drinking too much water.              When drinking too much water, the interstitial fluid is diluted, thus sodium concentration outside cells are lower than inside cells. Therefore the interstitial fluid outside cell becomes hypotonic, and the intracellular fluid that is inside the cell becomes hypertonic. Salt is an electrolyte, Na⁺ ions cannot defuse through the semiselective cell membrane (it needs the sodium potassium pump to facilitate transport). On the other hand, water molecules can defuse in and out of the cell membrane. Osmosis is the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane. So osmosis will occur and water will defuse from hypotonic fluid to hypertonic fluid, which in this case is into the cell. The result would be causing cells to swell and burst. If blood cell are damaged, then the body will have oxygen deficiency, resulting in fatigue. If brain cells swell and burst, this will also damage the brain, resulting in coma or even death.              This information could benefit peoples’ lives and/or society in order to prevent dangerous situations from happening to them if they are an athlete participating in an athletic event."
