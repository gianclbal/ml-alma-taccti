2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,678,"Firstly, I started watching greys anatomy(yes i know) and i loved it and started to think about a career in medicine or science. I then enrolled in an AP Bio class in my junior year. I really enjoyed my AP Bio class, and excelled quickly. I had an amazing teacher, who was also one of my most memorable teachers. He taught well, and engaged the students. My mom got cancer in the middle of that year, so I was around a lot of doctors and hospitals, not to mention the main focus of my AP Bio class was cancer ironically, because the teacher himself had cancer in his leg a few years prior, and made it the central teaching tool in his class. All of these events combined to interest me in the science field. I don't know yet what specifically I want to do, and I don't know yet if I am able to be around blood and sick people, but I hope to find out. I think I can, but I know that I immensely enjoy biology, so I might start looking into other career options if becoming a doctor doesn't work out. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,669,"I want to go into my major because it is what I am passionate about. I am majoring in Biology with a concentration in Microbiology, because it is the best path to become a Clinical Lab Scientist. When I was in middle school, my favorite subject was science because I was able to learn interesting things about the world we live in. As a kid, I had many ""Why?"" questions like ""why are our eyes colored?"" and this curiosity grew as I took classes like Physiology and Geology. Then in high school, I became confused with what I wanted my career to be, and it was very unclear to me. Throughout the four years, I took a total of seven different science classes and was president of a chemistry club. Even with this focus on science, I still had no clue what I wanted to do. It wasn't until I started working at The Exploratorium that allowed me to learn science every day that I was there. This opened up many opportunities for me and I got a higher position working as an intern in the Biology Lab and I got to work with hundreds of different living systems. I started to form a better understanding of what I wanted to do, which is to work in the science field but to also help people rather than do research, which lead me to focus on the medical field as well."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,675,"I want to go into my major because I want to be a pediatrician. Ever since I was little I’ve always wanted to be a pediatrician because I love kids and I wanted my career to be helping people but I also wanted to be a registered nurse. With both of these jobs, I would need to major in biology so after my first four years of college I can go either way. And regardless of which I pick I would still be helping people."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,673,My major is psychology and I’m planning on minoring in biology. I chose this major because the psychological aspect of life interests me and I also want to go on to be in the medical field. I thought psychology would be an interesting field to enter so that I could really become better at understanding the complex concepts that are psychology. I’m minoring in biology because I need the biological part of it as well and I think studying the two would make for a good skill set as a doctor. Ultimately I want my major to lead me to become an obgyn so that when I get there I have the skill to be their for my patience on an emotional and professional level. It’s one of the only fields that’s interested me and that I’ve felt passionate about 
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,672,"Imagining myself back to my freshman semester at SFSU, I came in having a desire to pursue a biology degree and, most importantly, to figure out what concentration of medicine I wanted to pursue. However, I still didn't feel as confident and intimidated about settling down with my major, so I decided not to declare biology early on. After taking GE's to figure out what I wanted for the past two years and going onto Spring 2020 as my first semester as a Biology major, I still don't have all the answers yet for why I want to go into my major. Which I should do more research into, but I genuinely have to passion for going into medicine, especially when I complete my pre-biology requisite, I want to declare into physiology and see what goes on from there. I still feel I intimidated of my abilities, but I've been trying to reassure myself that I belong here. I chose my major because when I want to see myself four years from now as a Bio-physio major, I want to be able to use my degree to contribute to society and furthering the science field. It sounds cliche, but I still have a lot of thinking to do about where I want to be and I hope I have a solid answer as I further my biology studies. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,619,"I am currently a biology major with a physiology emphasis and chemistry minor ( waiting to add another minor just not sure which one). I've talked to my advisor and he said it would be better to add another minor to make the med school application look better, so hopefully I'll do that soon and it will be related to health-sciences. With my major I really really hope to get into med school and hopefully later become a neurosurgeon. I've been into medicine since I was really young because most of my family are in this industry, and growing up with it has helped me a lot. Neuro is currently my top 1 choice, but I am obviously open to other specialties, I really hope to get a view of all of them in med school and going with an open mind is really important to see what I really like once I can experience it. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,674,"Initially, I wanted to become a veterinarian, but a lot of people are making me feel like I am not smart enough to be one. When I tell people that I want to become a vet, they say “wow, that’s a lot of years in school!” or “wow, that’s hard to get into!”. It makes me feel like I shouldn’t even try. My major is biology with concentration in zoology. Then I was going to get my master’s at UC Davis for vet school. I feel like I do want to work with animals, but I don’t know exactly what to do. I said vet because that’s the best way to help animals because I’m healing them. After working as a dog caretaker for almost a year and volunteering at animal shelters, I decided that I still want to work with animals. In fact, I want to work with all kinds of animals, from farm animals to wild animals. That just sounds so awesome to me. I also want to become a dog trainer soon. But I want to do an internship at a zoo to see if that’s a good career job for me because it sounds awesome too. I could go on about animals, I just love them!"
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,671,I have decided to pursue a degree in zoology because I've always had a passion for helping animals in danger and love helping animals that are sick or injured. This passion started at such a young age because I lived at a farm and took care of all different kinds of farm animals.  I want to go into this major because I want to help restore the wildlife that is put into danger every day. I want to study different animals and learn from them. My goal is to help restore certain animals that are close to going extinct because of people hunting them or damaging their natural habitats. I want to be the voice of these animals since they don't have a voice of there own. I want to make people aware of animals that are going extinct and the dangers that they are going through because of the disasters we are causing like cutting done their habitats to make wood or causing forest fires and burning down there homes. I also want to make aware that some of these animals are being hunted for there fur or teeth living behind there children causing them to die off. There is also climate change that is damaging certain animal populations that people aren't fully aware of or believe and that is were people like zoologies could come in and example some of these issues and educate the youth and hope to target the older generation into changing their minds. My goal of going into this major is trying to find a solution in the animal kingdom and hope to restore animals close to extinction 
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,362,"Since little I wanted to be a Veterinarian, but life happens and Veterinarian being a school during the day, it was impossible. I had to work, so I ended up studying Business Administration during the evening after work. Now, the time came where I was able to study anything I want, and I am chasing my dream. Helping animals has always been my passion, and with the knowledge I think I can do more of what I do now.Sometimes I think if I really need to be in school again, it is not easy after being retired to go back to homework. But here I am with works, a notebook and a pencil again."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,348,"My major is Biology and I am going with a concentration in physiology. I chose this major because I want to go into the medical field. Specifically, I want to be a pediatric surgeon. It has been my life dream to be able to go out and help people, I have always loved working with kids as well. All of my previous jobs and my current ones I have worked with kids. I use to work with kids on the spectrum and I enjoyed it. Another reason I want to help kids, even kids with disabilities is because of my brother. He has been my biggest inspiration my whole life. My brother marky is 23 and has rare disability, he is. undisagnose and cannot walk nor talk. When growing up we have seen many doctors and none wanted to see him because he was a ""liability"" and they didnt know what was wrong and it sucked. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,683,I want to go into my major because I initially wanted to be a veterinarian. I am not sure that is the field I want to go into anymore but I feel like I do want to be in something that has to do with science so it is still important for me to stay in this major. When I first started university I didn't think I would be so iterested in science especially not when my career choice changed but I found that although my first career choice didn't work out I am still interested in staying in the science field. I am not sure what my career choice is yet but I know I am in the right major for when I do figure it out.
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,681,"It was only until fairly recently that I decided I wanted to study biology in the hopes to eventually work in the medical field. Both of my parents work in the medical field, my mom being a nurse and my dad an obstetrician. Growing up being able to observe their lifestyle and work schedule has really attracted me to the field. I've also had long talks with them regarding getting into their profession and this has reassured me as to what I want to do with my life. Finally settling on biology as a major took a while though. Initially it was kinesiology then that changed to business, eventually turning into biology which I plan to stick with if all goes well. I can't say that it's been a long term goal to eventually work in the medical field but rather something that recently came up. The dream would to eventually become an anesthesiologist but we'll see. That Profession really has me intrigued and that's why I would really want to work towards that.        "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,670,"I want to go into my major because I really want to go on to get a masters in public health and/or go to medical school or physician assistants school. To be able to do the things I want in my career I need these degrees to be qualified andI can't see myself doing anything else but working in public health and medicine. My biggest dream since I was a kid was to one day be able to join Doctors without Borders and in order for that to happen I need to be a medical personnel! So this is the first step in getting there and my major of Physiology gives me a good foundation of knowledge to make it to the next step in this process. Not only that but the other majors under the Biology/Health Sciences umbrella just don't interest me as much. Biochem, Nutrition, General Biology, Kinesiology and Microbiology are all other great options but Physiology just fits me really well."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,685,"At the moment my major is Pre-biology, but my plan is to go into bio-physiology when I finish my prerequisites that I’m supposed to complete. The reason why I want to major in bio-phys is because I’ve always been fascinated by the human body and how it functions and I’ve always wanted to find out how to maintain a healthy body and what better way to do that than studying about the human body. With this major I initially wanted to become an emergency doctor or a regular doctor, but recently I see how much school is required and at first I wasn’t worried about the amount of school, but I don’t want to go through 4-7 more years of school. Now with my major I want to become a physician’s assistant and that only requires 6-7 years of school. Also, with majoring in bio it better prepares me to go into the medical field and this major is one of the majors that has a lot of career and academic advising. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,682,"The reason why I would like to join the biology major is that I really want to be working in an environment that I feel more confident.  I always wanted to be a pediatrician since I was very young. I really love babies and little kids in general, which motivated me to eventually want to be a pediatrician. I know that the biology major is not an easy one and that it might take longer than any other major but at the end, I know it will be worth it because I will be doing something that I like and something that I worked for very hard. Helping young lives is something that I know ill make me happy and just learn more as well while I work. So far biology has been such fun, interesting, stressing and crazy but I have really enjoyed it and therefore I do not regret my decision."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,677,"Huiping DowDell  Science 230  3 May 2020  Reflective Journaling Essay #4              I am a junior transfer student at SFSU majoring in Biochemistry. I attended College of Marin before transferring to SFSU this spring. I chose my major of Biochemistry because it is a subject I am very interested in and I plan to take the Dental Admission Test and apply to Dental school. My career goal is to become a dentist and serve the bay area community. My personal motivation for this career is based on a couple of factors. First, my father was a dentist and ever since I was young girl I thought about the possibility of becoming a dentist. I have already been working as a Dental Assistant and I have been working with a group of dentists for over 10 years in the bay area. I have met some very good dentists who inspired and encouraged me to achieve my goal. I learned a lot about the profession and how it provides an important service to patients’ health and well being. I don’t have any other career goal other than becoming a dentist. The only other careers I would be interested in would be some type of work in the field of dentistry. I already have a lot of insight about a career in dentistry. However, I plan to seek out career counselors and other professionals who can mentor me on how to best pursue my goal."
