Year,Semester,Class,Type,Section,Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,669,I am in Sci 230 because I want to get ahead and be very strong in my first biology course because I did very bad in my classes last semester. I failed a class and I did not do as well as I could have so this semester I want to do above and beyond better than before. I have been going to Philz coffee shop to study for two hours on Mondays just to get in as much information as well as prepare for the upcoming week by doing the Self Assessment Quizzes. This class will give be a better opportunity and chance to do well in Bio 230 because of the extra clarification on terms and topics that I cannot fully understand in the lecture. This class is my extra effort in trying to be a better student and set me on the right path for college.
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,670,I am here in this class because bio 230 is the first class in the biology series and it is the foundation to everything we learn from here on out. A class specifically for studying and really understanding the concepts that are being thrown at us is exactly what I need because if I’m going to make it through as a biology major I need to learn everything for comprehension and not just for memorization. I’d hate to get into the upper div classes and still genuinely understand what I’ve learned and have to continuously struggle to piece together everything. I know biology is largely based on building one concept off of another so by taking sci 230 it will help me make sure that the foundation of everything we’re learning is not lost on me. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,671,The reason I am here in this class is to be able to succeed in Bio 230 and learn to develop my study skills because I have a learning disability that sometimes makes it hard for me to learn like your typical student I tend to think differently. This used to bring me down at times and made me believe that I couldn't succeed in anything I do. I had zero confidence in myself to be where I am and never thought I would be in college. This somtimes tends to bring me down Being a zoology major had always been a dream of mine and I just want to be able to accomplish that goal and make not only myself but my family proud of everything they have sacrificed for me since I wasn't able to get FAFSA to help me achieve my goal and pay for half of my schooling. In being in this class I strongly feel that it will help me accomplish the goal of opening up my own veterinarian clinic and helping animals that are going extinct and make my clinic a sanctuary for animals that have gotten hurt in the wild or by people trying to hunt them. This is a huge goal for me that I hope someday becomes a reality and I am able to help save thousands of animals around the world. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,362,I find it beneficial to have this class as a supplemental to BIO230. In lecture is too difficult to ask questions when in doubt and in this class we can ask and have a better understanding. Here we do practical exercises that help as well.0
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,672,"Rosalyn Prem February 24th, 2020Alma Journal #1Question: ""Why am I here?"" I am here as a bio-major because I believe that just like anyone of us in this classroom, we are all able to become scientists. My purpose within entering the biofield is to give back to the community and to commit to an environment where medicine is involved. I already have recognized that I wouldn't mind spending more time and dedication into being at school as long as I pursue higher education. I have doubts about my capabilities, however, even with my doubts and questions, I still feel that it is normal to still be going into the world not getting everything right and not knowing all the answers. Throughout the semester, I have gone through almost a month changing into this major, while I had many frustrations with time and juggling multiple other assignments, I still feel very happy to explain and share the things I learned in this class to my other friends and such. I enjoy going into the labs hands-on and having to be in a collaborative environment. I know I still feel like I'm at the bottom sometimes, but I've taken the first intuitive into being able to accomplish that goal. I am here because I want to be able to prove my spot and that I belong in this environment. I still get really hard on myself each time I slip up, but I hope I can be more of a best friend to myself in some way. But I'm fearing that all the workload has turned me off from my inspirations as well because I am not well adjusted to it as of now. But I am doing everything on time and getting there, so I trust myself more. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,673,I am in this class because I need extra help studying for bio 230. I am a visual learner and for me bio 230 is not a long enough class to accomplish the kind of learning I need. I’ve heard how difficult biology could be and I figured taking two hours out of my day could be the difference between passing the class and failing it. The reason I’m here has proven to be a smart decision of mine because this class has helped me learn so much compared to my lecture class. It helps me feel like an expert on subjects and have an open space with classmates who are struggling with the same things I am. Having such a large lecture class can be intimidating and it’s easy to feel like everyone understands it while you’re falling behind. I’ve been able to make connections here with friends that explain anything I’m confused about in simple terms without making me feel like I’m dumb for not knowing. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,674,"I signed up for this class because I wanted to have the best resources available to study for Bio 230. It's been helping so far because we do go over a lot of information. I get shy to participate so I just observe, listen, and take notes as much as i can. I'm here because I struggle a lot with science classes, and talking to people to form a study group. I didn't really study with anyone for the first exam but I think i'll be able to for the second exam. There are a lot of reasons why i could be taking this class and i'm glad i'm taking it. I ended up dropping a class that was during this class so that i could get help for bio 230 instead of trying to teach myself the information. Office hours seem scary to me sometimes, because i don't know what questions to ask. I like this class because they go over important information that will for sure be on the exam. Thank you!"
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,675,I’m in this class to get all the help I can. I find it really hard to retain information during the lecture because it’s so much information to receive in such a short amount of time. And the class is huge so the professors can’t check for understanding with every single student. Sci 230 really makes things more clear. Honestly I would have absolutely no clue about central dogma and cell division if it wasn’t for this class. 
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,676,"I am in the SCI-230 class to better understand what I am learning in both the lecture and lab class. Helping me be in a smaller scale room with other peers that are as well trying to learn the same material asking and getting questions, we all found confusing answered. It’s essentially a larger study group that we have more hands-on review on what we are learning. As well it is a great network tool to meet more people that are moving into the same or similar major that I am intending to work towards. I have met many people that I now talk to outside of class and help each other with assignments and made our own mini study groups at the library. The class is once a week so it does get hard to be able and fit all 3 days of lecture but we review the major topics and that helps me put the subtopics in place where they correspond to and basically wrapping my head around all the terms that are learned."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,619,"Why am I here? First of all, I am in this class to get as much help as I can with Biology. Bio is not easy for me at all, I like it, but it has been one of the hardest subjects for me since High School. I am currently a Biol - Physio major, which means I have to take gen-ed bio whether I like it or not. With this class, I not only hope to get as much help as I can but also to meet people in order to make a study group and make connections for the future. Why am I in college? I hope to get into Medical School after SFSU, hoping to become a doctor later on in my life. I first chose San Francisco State because I was a fashion design major until I changed it to Bio last semester, but it was a really good school and city for all fashion related things. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,677,"Huiping DowDell  24 February 2020  Science 230 Reflective Journaling Essay #1  Why Am I Here?              I am a here at SFSU as a transfer student majoring in Biochemistry. I attended College of Marin before transferring to SFSU this spring. After earning my BS degree in Biochemistry I plan to take the Dental Admission Test and apply to Dental school. My career goal is to become a dentist and serve the bay area community. I am a dental assistant and have been working as one for 15 years. I am inspired and encouraged by all the dentists in my office. Earlier in my life I wasn’t  able to make enough money or time to go to college. However, I eventually was able to make it and work on my college degree. I am here for this class to learn more about Biology and to help me in my other classes in the future. I believe that Biology is one of the major subjects someone needs to understand if you work in the medical field. What I am learning now will transfer over to other subjects like Microbiology and Biochemistry. Also, the Biology Lab class is helping to improve my lab skills. I know this journey will not be easy, I but I am doing my best, studying hard, and trying to accomplish my goal."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,678,"I chose to take Sci 230 to have a larger community around me so I could have more structure and help with Bio 230. I thought that sci 230 would give me more insight and go in depth about topics we just blow through in lecture ( and I was right!). I found Sci 230 to be super helpful in my studying and getting me to really grasp concepts. Sci 230 gives me more time to review everything and let it sink it, or to go over questions with everyone else. I don't have to best study methods initially, I tend to procrastinate a lot and cram, so this gives me more time to study. I chose Bio 230 (mainly because it's a requirement of my major) but also because it's and introductory biology course for my major. I learned a lot of the same material in my AP Biology course(mostly about cancer) and it feels like a good refresher before I go even further, considering my major is Biology. I want a good foundation in Biology so that when I get to more advanced topics, I will have a better understanding(unlike some of my other classes like math)."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,679,"I'm in SCI 230 because I intend to use as many resources as possible to find success in Bio 230. It's important to me to not just succeed in this class, but excel. I don't want a B in Bio 230, I want at minimum an A- since this is a required course for applying to grad school. And not only do I want to get the grade, but I want to understand the material so I can apply it to my future career in Physical Therapy (hopefully!). While i might not need to specifically known translation and transcription or anything like that for my specific career goals, it'll give me the background I need to be good at my job. SCI 230 is meant to help me achieve these goals and if I didn't take this supplemental course and I ended up finishing the semester with less than an A-, I'll never forgive myself for not taking advantages of the opportunities provided for me. Also it's helpful to hear things from student's perspectives rather than a professor, and have people to bounce ideas off of/ask questions I don't ask in lecture."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,680,"I'm slightly confused by the intent of the question as it could be an existential question or simply asking why is someone enrolled in this particular class. I wanted this course to establish a solid foundation of the biology 230 coursework. Having previously taken the class, I understood the material, but I began to realize how important the fundamental concepts being discussed are in the grand scheme of the course and all courses after. I unfortunately had some personal issues arise and fell behind in the class resulting in the need to retake the lecture and exam. Four weeks in, and I'm happy to say that despite the redundancy, hearing and seeing the concepts explained in different ways has been helpful in not just memorizing answers, but understanding the ""why."" "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,681,I am here so that I can get a better understanding for the concepts of biology. I knew going into the semester I was going to need some extra help with this class so when I found out about this class I didn't hesitate to sign up. I also needed the extra unit that this class provides so it was a win win scenario for me. I am studying biology because I want to get into the medical field as a profession. Taking this class along with the lecture and lab is my first big step into the world of biology as I haven't taken a biology related course since early high school.
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,682,"The reason why I am here is that I want to be someone in this life. Education is not a luxury but a need, an educated person is more accountable than one that has not to have as much education. My goal is to graduate from this institution with a degree. I am here because I want to continue learning and I want to become a pediatrician and work with little children. I am also here for my parents because they have helped me throughout my short college career and I want to make them feel proud of me, they already are since I am here in SFSU but I want to make them feel like all their sacrifices are worth it. I am also here to set an example that it is possible to do whatever you want, that you can pursue any career. It is not easy and its time consuming but in the end its all worth it. I am here because I believe that I will be someone that can give a lot back to the community. I want to set an example for my siblings, I want them to do better than what I am doing, I want them to achieve way more than what I had. I am here for a reason and I am here to figure it out. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,683,"I am here because I know the class will help me study and dedicate some time to the bio 230 class. If I wasn’t in this class I would probably be home right now we’re I can easily be distracted from studying. Here I can review topics so the information is more likely to stick with me in the long run witch is the goal. I know going over for the information even if I already know it will help me a lot. I have trouble sharing or asking my questions in the bio seminar because the class is so big so I feel intimidated at times. Since, the class is a lot smaller than the seminar it is easier to ask questions. We also have more time to answer them and get into more detail wich is very helpful for me. My main reason for signing up was to spend extra time reviewing as I knew I would have trouble procrastinating this semester wich I am trying to avoid."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,348,"The reason I am here in this specific class is because I previously taken biology 230 which is quite embarrassing to say. I had previously taken bio my first semester here at state and I was going through the college transition which lead me to being homesick and I was very off the books. I wasn’t paying or doing enough to pass to the class so I ended with a D+. I’m retaking it this semester and I am more confident in passing. When you guys had came and explained the class I wish I had taken it sooner. This class has been a great way for me to start of the semester. I have had better understanding with biology as a whole. Being in the this class has helped me phenomenally with being able to actually grasp the concepts. I am the type of person who needs to really have a one on one and have detailed notes in able to understand, which this class brings. I believe working in smaller groups and being able to actually give an opinion helps greatly as well only because there’s not a bunch of people judging if you are wrong. I’m hoping to continue learning all the great biology concepts and take them with me on my journey to my career. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,684,I’m here to become successful and try to ace this biology class. I signed up for this sci course in order to get extra support and to try to master everything I need to master to succeed in my goal in acing this class. I really want to be the best scientist I can be and very much use my time wisely while I am in school to achieve and to strive far in school just like everyone else. I find this class really special and safe because there’s such little people. I find sci classes awesome because you don’t really get shy to ask questions when your really confused about something. I can’t sit in a class with more then 200 people and just raise my hand because I feel like I’d be the only one confused about what I’m asking while everyone gets it. In this sci class I am comfortable asking whatever I need to ask.
