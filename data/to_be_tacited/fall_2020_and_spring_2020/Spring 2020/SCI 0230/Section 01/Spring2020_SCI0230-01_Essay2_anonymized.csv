2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,673,"When life gets challenging I take a moment to breathe so I don’t become so overwhelmed. I have bad anxiety at times and it’s really easy for me to become overwhelmed and to overthink things. I try to think of all the times I overcame challenges in my life and how this too shall pass. I also tend to have a bad habit of just ignoring the issue till i have to come face to face with it which is one of my toxic coping mechanisms I’m working on, since that’s usually what makes my life challenging in the first place. Overall, being challenged by life I do everything I can to prevent any dark thoughts to fill me or to discourage me from keeping on. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,348,"When life gets challenging for me, I personally take time to myself to think. I like to reflect on everything if I have the time for is and most importantly I really like to go and hang out with some of my best friends. I am personally not the type of person to tell all my problems to however I let them all build up and eventually Ill talk. I also really like to be with my family, whether we are just being lazy or running errands. For school, I personally have to take a whole day to myself to reflect on everything, and most of the time I will just take a nap. I feel like when I take a nap its a way to relieve my stress and not have ANY thoughts on school.  I also really enjoy grabbing coffee as it gets rid of my headaches.

2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,672,"Currently, life is a challenge right now with the whole pandemic and trying to adjust to online classes. When life usually gets challenging, usually I get stressed and try to tackle too many things at once and it is pretty unhealthy. To be honest, since with the new system-I feel like im unknowingly slipping a little bit. But that is also due to other factors in my life bringing me down and trying to cope with realizing it has happened. One way that I do when life gets challenging, is finding ways to stress relief when it gets too much and the thing that has been helping is playing Animal Crossing with friends. Another way that I do when life gets challenging (academically), is to seek resources from instructors, tutoring, students, and then even videos online. Examining and realizing your confusions is better than trying to struggle on your own, so I always value trying to seek help and trying to aid someone as always. I hope even with my slip-up affected my academics a bit mentally, that I can recover as I always did and trying to be optimistic about the new online system till the remainder of the semester. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,683,When life gets challenging there are two strategies I tend to follow. I used to have the habit just give myself time to rest are forget about the problem. However I know that this doesn't make the problem go away and It comes back worse or just adds on to other challenges I may have so I have been practicing other strategies. Other times I will continue to the next thing and hope that as I am doing something else I will find a solution to the problem. However I noticed that both of these are avoiding the problem so I am beginning to address the situation right away and if the solution takes time I will do the tactics I mentioned before. Ultimately I see challenges as opportunities to learn and gain experience so they do not seem so much like an obstacle and are easier to deal with.
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,685,"When life gets challenging I do a few things. I keep the mindset that things will get better and it won’t stay like this forever. If something gets difficult then it’s time for me to make a change to resort to something that’ll help out my situation. Change is the process of life itself. I get into the mindset that things are changing everyday in life and when it gets challenging I’ll still have to make changes. Also, my attitude can determine my situation or degrade it. I can’t have a positive life with a negative attitude because when negativity controls your thoughts overall it restricts behavior and and actions, it actually makes me more close minded. I also tell myself how strong I am to rise above this, don’t allow my temporary situation to destroy me or my peace of mind. Failure tends to make people stronger, let my failures become lessons learned. Lastly, I know I’m not trapped. I'm just in a messed up/challenging situation that I can fix, it may take time and it may not, but I can’t dwell on the bad, I have to rise above it and become wiser. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,682,When life gets challenging I always have to remember that everything is going to be OK. Although maybe the situation is very challenging I will get upset and feel like I can't do it but the truth is that I can actually do it. When Life gets challenging all I have to do is better than last time. The challenge to do better than before. I have to admit that sometimes when there are challenges those challenges make you not want to give it your all because of the fear of failing or not making it through. When life gets challenging it's really time and energy-consuming we all face different challenges all the time. It's never easy but some way or the other we always make it through. Especially when we are in college challenges always seem to be more constant and that is when we act up and we try to get over those challenges such as a class or a relationship. What I am trying to say is that challenges shape you and they make you and shape you a certain way. It all really depends on how you want too over those challenges.
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,681,"There are a couple things that I do when life gets challenging. And the timing couldn't be more perfect than to go over the methods I use to counter these challenging times we are going through right now with the pandemic. One thing that I try to do is I try not to think too much. Now this may sound pretty simple but it works for me, as I'm somebody that tends to overthink way too much for my own good. This overthinking leads to greater things such as anxiety attacks and lack of sleep which I'm not for having from time to time. So I've definitely been living life day by day, hour by hour, and minute by minute in order to keep my mind at bay. Another way I deal with challenging times would be a trip to the gym. I go to the gym roughly five days a week, every week. This helps me blow off some steam and puts my mind in a good spot. However, now that all the gyms are closed due to the coronavirus that's kind of out of the equation. Anyways, those are my methods of stress-relief and dealing with the challenges life brings me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,669,"When life gets challenging, I always decide to take a pause or a break to rest my mind and give myself a peaceful moment. This can vary from a couple hours to days because of how tough my commitments can get. After taking a long and well deserved break, I get to work and do not stop until I catch up all my work, or complete everything that needs to be done. I get in the headspace by cleaning my area, turning on a really pleasant candle and making myself some iced coffee. This allows me to not get distracted by exterior factors and to just let me focus on what needs to be done. When I get to work, I begin by diving everything. An example would be to finish the quicker and easier assignments to get them out of the way and then work on the bigger more important projects after. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,362,"Life gives us challenges all the time and they can become too much if we think we cannot overcome them. The way I address life and the way I think about every change, challenge, new event is by thinking positive, adapt and overcome. Over the years I have experience how easy life is, we just need to accept what it brings us, we need to adapt, overcome and have a right attitude, by doing these, everything becomes easy, simple.   It is what it is and I cannot change it, but I can accept it. Not accepting things is what makes the challenges life gives us difficult and make our life miserable.  If there is a problem, does it have a solution? If yes, then why worry about it and if there is a problem, doesn’t have a solution? So, why worry about it."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,670,"When life gets challenging I tend to not realize it until it graduates from challenging to overwhelming, and at that point I have no choice but to step back and take a second to think and reevaluate. When it's school that's being challenging I know to go to my professor's office hours-even if to just let them know that I have either fallen behind unknowingly or to ask clarifying questions, just checking in with my professors is a great first step to recover from challenges. If at that point I still feel lost or confused, we're so lucky to be living in a time where the internet is full not only of information, but also of educational videos or websites specifically of whatever topic we're learning in Biology. There is no shortage of information and resources out there beyond the Professors."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,679,"When life get's challenging, the best thing I can do for myself is set aside some dedicated time to clean my apartment. I'll make my bed, get all my laundry done, take a shower and put on sweatpants, make a simple yummy meal, and then light a candle. Then I'll let myself relax in that clean atmosphere watching Netflix or using social media for a while. This is kind of like a reset button that helps because usually when I'm feeling overwhelmed, it's because I feel like I've lost control of a certain part of my life. Generally, the cleanliness of my room directly reflects how cluttered my mind is feeling at that moment. So, if I clean my room, my mind will feel less cluttered and I will have the illusion that I'm actually on top of things. That, and going to sleep early that night (if possible) definitely helps. A nice walk along the beach (I live near the beach) or going for a run or going to a field to play soccer or meeting up with friends always puts me in a better mood too. I have this problem where I overload myself with responsibilities so it's important to take advantage of the time I have free time and do something unstressful that also feels productive as to minimize my guilt for ""wasting days"""
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,677,"Huiping DowDell  15 March 2020  Science 230 Reflective Journaling Essay #2  What do I do when life gets challenging?              This is a tough question to answer. I have faced situations in my life before where life got challenging, but I don’t know that I did anything special to get through it. I just did what I had to do. Usually, life gets challenging when there is not enough time in the day to do everything that needs to be done. I remember in the past when I studied at College of Marin I took two really hard classes at the same time – Calculus III and Physics II. I remember there were times that I didn’t think I would have enough time to get all of the reading and homework done. There were two things I did that helped me get through this hard semester. First, I got well organized. I made sure I put all of the dates for important assignments, quizzes, and exams on one single calendar. That way I could figure out when I needed to use my time on a certain assignment or study for an exam. Second, I was lucky to find a study partner who was in both classes with me. We ended up studying together several times a week and sometimes on weekends. I think that by staying organized and then having a good study partner helped me to get through a challenging period in my life."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,619,"What do I do when life gets challenging? When life gets challenging there are a few things I've learned to do to calm myself down for a little bit until everything else gets a little bit better at least. First of all, I like to pause everything for a minute and breathe. Breathing exercises have helped me a lot throughout these past years, specially during test and final season. Another way is to do a sport. Since I was young I've been playing different sports and I have notices with time that these help with anxiety and just in general with stressful situations because it gets my mind off things. Lastly, talking to my family and spending time with my friends also helps a lot because I get to get my mind off things as well and enjoy while being able to talk to them about what is going on. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,680,"When life becomes challenging, I've been trained to be resilient and find a way to overcome any obstacle I encounter. However, that is sometimes easier said than done. I turn to my family when I have issues and ask for help when I am overwhelmed. I've learned that I can't do everything by myself and began learning to lean on others for assistance when needed, and return the favor. If it weren't for my family, I wouldn't have a chance at being successful. Returning to school has forced me to be more humble and accept that there are many things that I do not know or don't understand immediately, despite being older than most students. I am discovering my strengths and weaknesses, and learning to take advantage of them to make the most of my collegiate career. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,671,"When I feel that life is getting challenging I stay a step back and I reevaluate why it is becoming challenging and try to figure out a way for me to conquer whatever that difficult challenge is. I also tend to ask my family for help and advice on how I can approach that challenge and they tend to guide me in the right direction. There are at times where I want to give up on life and just take a break and stop doing things that are difficult but I tend to overcome it by reaching out to someone who has gone through what I have and I tell myself not to give up because that isn't how I was raised. I was always raised to keep going no matter how hard life gets. I have always been told that after every rainstorm there is a rainbow at the end. Implying that even when life gets hard it always pays off to continue fighting towards the end. Another thing that I like to do that helps me a lot is taking breaks and go do something fun with my friends so I can take my mind off things for a while before life sets in again. It's kinda like therapy for me to be able to hang out with friends and just getting to talk to them makes my day. For example, we go to the movies or just having a girl's night helps a lot with the stress and allows me to take a step back and just breathe. Those are just some of the stuff that I tend to see myself doing when life gets challenging Just because of how I was raised and taught by others. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,684,"When life gets challenging many people react in so many ways. I usually tend to give up and not try anymore but this semester I made promises and goals to myself that even when life is at its toughest I will fight for my success and I will achieve my goals. This semester has been so hard for me not even because school is hard or classes are tough but more because of things occurring in my personal life. My best friend, my little brother passed out out of no where and we rushed him to the hospital and doctors told us he has a huge brain tumor in the back of his head. They confirmed it recently that it was cancerous. Along with keeping up with school and stressing over my brother I still fought for him and to make sure I was still keeping up with school. There’s been nights without sleep being at the hospital by his side. It’s all been so hard to keep up with but yet I still kept up and he soon has to start chemo and radiation which will make it much harder but I’m still here. I feel like with the corona virus going around school is going to be a bit tougher keeping up with it all online. I think it’ll be hard on me because we basically have to try and teach ourselves what we would learn in classes."
