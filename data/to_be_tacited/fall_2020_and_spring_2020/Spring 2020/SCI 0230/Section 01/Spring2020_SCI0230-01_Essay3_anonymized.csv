2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,348,"My whole family all got pregnant at an early age and was never able to go to college. My whole family including my grandparents all live through me every semester and it helps me go through college. The fact that I am able to go to college and have these struggles really pushes me to keep going. I especially push through for my brother who is special needs and cannot walk nor talk, he is the reason I chose the Biology path because not many doctors would be able to help him because he was a liability. So with all that being said my family not being able to have this experience really pushes me to do the best I possibly can. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,670,"The values of the people in my family have helped me navigate through college by giving me a bigger picture, and broader reason to be here. Like most first generation kids I partly am attending university for myself and my own goals, but also largely because it's what my parents immigrated here for-and it would make them so proud to have children that graduate from American schools. But why it gives me a bigger picture reason to be here is because my family's community and culture heavily emphasizes helping and supporting those around you as much as possible, and luckily biology is a major that shares the same ideals. This common goal between the two has helped me navigate through college so far by giving me a support system in a difficult field and allowing me to help those around me with study groups or just people to rant to. Since biology is inherently a major centered around being in service or understanding of others it has allowed me to not only practice what my family preaches, but to benefit from a community of students who do the same."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,682,"The values of my community and family have helped me make good friends and helped me be successful in my courses because I have been honest and respectable to my professors. I have taken advantage of all the programs in the school to be social and academically successful. I have learned to be open-minded and just be myself most importantly. If you have to pretend to be someone else so that people can like you then they're not worth being your friends. Overall, my values always remind me why I am here and they remind me of all my goals and just how proud I want to make my family."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,673,For me my family has been a big help in helping me navigate college. Education is really valued in my family because of the fact we’re from a 3rd world country and they’ve always motivated me to get the highest form of education I want and to pursue my dreams because no dream is too big. Their views have really kept me motivated to pursue a career in medicine and has taught me to not undermine my intelligence and what I can accomplish. I’ve gained so much strength from having a support system that doesn’t put down my biggest dream. My moms encouraged my brothers and I to pursue education not worrying about money even if college is a big expense because she sees the investment in our future to be priceless. These values are the reason I take school so seriously and the reason I was able to find a career I’m passionate about 
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,681,"I feel as if the values of my family and surrounding community have definitely influenced my choice to attend college and pursue a degree. All of my older siblings, as well as my parents, have attended college and this has motivated my to pursue my own professional career just as they have. In my household it's normal to attend college after high school, as a matter of fact it is normal in the area where I live to receive a higher education. Many if not most of the kids that I went to high school with have all gone off to college as I have and that's just how things are. This helps me navigate through college because I don't want to let anybody down back home, but I'm also competitive and want to achieve what all of my peers are currently after. And it doesn't stop after undergrad studies, post graduate school is definitely on my mind because if I want to end up living where I currently reside I'm going to need a pretty good job to do so and to support a future family."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,672,"The values of my family helped me navigate through college because I am the first generation of my family to go straight to a four-year university and they are my sole motivators in life. What keeps me going is being able to be a role model to my younger brother in order to go through school as I had to figure a few things out on my own but with the aid of my mother being a supportive figure through my life, I wouldn't have been able to achieve most of the opportunities I had without her help. So far during this hard time, my family has been supportive of letting me have the appropriate mental space, time and my mom has been a viable resource when I have any confusion on assignments. Also what gets me through school is remembering the dream I wanted to pursue and how badly I want to put in the time and effort to graduate and push forward my endeavors. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,683,The values of my community helped me navigate through college because once I started college I began to understand other peoples values and why they were so important to them and it helped me to better understand how and why everyones different. It really helps and shows me that there are a lot of other ways of living. although I already knew this my community helps me to experience it first hand which gives it a different perspective.

She has helped me navigate through college by helping push me to do things by myself and learn to be more independent because of her I have more confidence in doing things alone. My sister is also a big important role in my academics in college because she has given me the strength to believe that I can succeed in anything I do I just have to believe in myself. Without the help of my family, I would be where I am now and I am so thankful for the opportunities that I have been given throughout my college experience. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,669,"I am a Hispanic/Latino student, with two immigrant parents from Mexico. I have grown up learning about my Mexican heritage and cultures as well as values. What I have learned is that family is the most important thing that we have. We value it more than anything else because our family defines who we are, who we should be, and who we can be. For me personally, choosing the college I wanted to go to was based on my family values that are important to me. I decided to stay with my family so that I can support them whenever they need it, as well as, to receive support if I ever need it. I have struggled with my classes in the past and my family has been there to provide me comfort and a home that I can always go to if I need it. I am very fortunate to have a family that I can lean on and I try to do my best for them."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,678,"I grew up in a predominantly white/asian community, and school was always a priority. Both my parents had very little education, and always instilled in my head that college was the goal. Neither sides of my family had ever gone to college, with some having never even set foot in a school. The fact that I was constantly going to school and prioritizing school all my life made me the black sheep of my family, as well as making it hard for me to connect with them. I remember growing up until today, my mindset has always been to get to college and do well in school. It has always just been expected of me, and I want to break the boundaries within my family. I am a low income student with mexican heritage so I always feel like I need to try my hardest. My dad's success has played a huge impact on me, giving me motivation that I really can do anything and be anything, because he started out with nothing and turned it into everything, and became somebody."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,675,I am a first-generation college student my family was beyond excited to hear that I would be going straight to a 4-year college right after high school. I know it's not always easy to keep up with school and people tend to drop out when things get too complicated. When I first started school it was very complicated for me because I had no clue what I was doing and being a first-generation college student my family wasn't able to tell me what to expect. I had to figure things out on my own but my family was rooting for me the whole way and they are with me through every challenge that I face. So when I feel like I want to give up I turn to my family to help me find the aspiration that I lost somewhere during the process. If it wasn't for them I wouldn't be where I am today.  
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,674,"My parents have always been supportive of my older sister and I’s school choices. They support us with the career of our choice, as long as we finish our bachelor’s degree from college. My parents really value school for us, and I think that’s because my dad was only able to attend school until middle school and my mom was a stay at home wife. When my parents moved to the United States, my dad worked in a trucking company and my mom took care of my sister and I. My mom took some college classes to work as a medical assistant, but she needed to care for us while my dad worked so she was always a stay at home wife. Up to this day, my mom is taking college classes because she wants to pursue a career in business. I look up to my mom so much because even after having two grown up daughters, she still wants to be college educated. Even though I don’t like school, I have never dropped out because I know I’ll be letting my parents down, so I do this for them. I have picked a career of my choice, but school is hard for me."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,679,"My family has been instrumental in not only my success so far in college, but even being able to pursue higher education. I'm fortunate that my grandpa has an apartment here in the city that I can stay at which allows me to attend school here. If I didn't have that apartment, I wouldn't be able to afford to go to SFSU, and I probably would have stayed home to attend a community college. Don't get me wrong, I believe there's absolutely nothing wrong with community colleges, in fact a large majority of my friends go to community. I just feel so fortunate to be able to go to a four year here in the city because it has opened me up to employment opportunities that the school I would have gone to in the east bay wouldn't be able to give me. So thanks to my grandpa who is giving me the chance to live here, and my parents in the east bay who are supporting my decision to move out, I have had access to so many amazing opportunities."
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,685,"I identify my community as people of color. Typically, we get discriminated against and looked down on because of how powerful we are and nobody really wants black power to show. In my community, there’s few people that make it to college and complete it due to dropping out of high school and middle school, but that gives me motivation to keep going and become a role model for my community to let them know that we all have a chance to change and make a difference, we just have to lean on each other. My friends that’s going to college we’re all apart of the same community and in high school we leaned on each other to find resources to help us get through school and go on to college, we know it’s going to be a struggle, but another one of our values are to look at the bigger picture and see the light at the end of the tunnel which is what we want to accomplish when we  grow up and how successful we want to be. "
2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,619,"For this essay on how the values of my community and family helped me navigate through college I think there are a lot of factors. First of all, I was born in Argentina and moved to the United States when I was 16; that means my first language is Spanish and also my culture and values are also from Argentina. Since I was very young, my family valued traveling and being open minded a lot. Argentina is a very closed minded and religious country, which is why they thought traveling would help me with this while growing up. When I was 12 I moved to Hong Kong for a a year and went to an Australian School, helping me with my english and also teaching me not only the Chinese culture, but also Australian. Later on, I moved to Spain. Even though Argentina was owned by Spain, they are two very different cultures and I got to learn more about the Spanish one. Lastly, I moved to the United States when I was 16 and learned more about this culture. Traveling since young and moving around countries have helped with being open minded, but also helped me adapt easily to new scenarios. "

2020,Spring,SCI 0230,SI,1,677,"Huiping Dowdell  Sci 230 Reflective Journaling Essay #3  11 April 2020              The values of my community and my family have had different effects on helping me navigate through college. When I was a young girl, my parents were very strict with me about studying for school. Their main focus on me was to do good in school. Everything else was secondary. I had friends that I played and had fun with, but in the end I had to work very hard to do well in school. I think that part of my family had the greatest influence on helping me learn how to be disciplined in my studying. The values of my family were to put education and studying first. One hard part of navigating through college I have found has been simply being able to do all of the little things like registering for classes, keeping track of important dates, and managing my time schedule. Sometimes these little things can be the hardest to keep track of and can cause the most stress besides studying for regular classes. Luckily I have had some great friends that have experience in going to college and helped me learn how to navigate through all of the administrative requirements involved. The values I learned from them are time management and the importance of being able to stay on top of multiple requirements at the same time. I now have been able to combine my discipline for studying for classes with a discipline for managing my time and keeping up with the administrative side of going through college."
