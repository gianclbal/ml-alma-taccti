it was not until someone came in our physics lecture and started explaining the sci course.,0,"['So, I scammed my friend to come with me to the first class because I did not want to go alone.']"

but then there's physics.,0,"['I am here to build off of what we learn in class, ask questions about topics that I am not understanding, and to build study groupsrelationships with my fellow peers']"
i have never taken a physics course in my life and it makes me very anxious because there are a number of people that have seen what we are covering previously and i have never seen any of it.,0,"['I am here to build off of what we learn in class, ask questions about topics that I am not understanding, and to build study groupsrelationships with my fellow peers']"
