"i have an obvious interest in studying how the universe operates, and very little of that has to do with life sciences from what has been demonstrated to me so far. it would seem that life is the exception, and that the physical laws are somehow connected to how life operates. gravity, thermodynamics, mass, acceleration, velocity, light, magnetic and electric forces are involved in every facet of reality. therefore, studying these subjects is required if youre trying to study the properties of the reality that we all share. life only seems to be a property of these subjects combined, which is the end result rather than the process. of course one could say this is a post hoc observation, but i would argue that these are evidences for how life occurred since it would appear that they're a mandatory part of the life existing. on an academic note, i have to take this class in order to finish my degree path and im uncertain whether or not i would if it wasnt required. i think in order to gain a competitive edge and to show initiative that i would, but that is just a guess. physics without calculus isnt that hard, and i feel for the physics majors who must do all of this with calculus since im finishing calculus 2.",1,"['On an academic note, I have to take this class in order to finish my degree path and Im uncertain whether or not I would if it wasnt required.']",1,"Matches Navigational theme: systemic navigation, temporal markers.",True
