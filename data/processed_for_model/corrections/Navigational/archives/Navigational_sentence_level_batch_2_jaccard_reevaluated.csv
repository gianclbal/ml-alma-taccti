Once I complete that I am a step closer into graduating. Once I graduate I can go to grad school and start ""it all over again."" After I finish my grad school I can finally actually start my life. Something ive been wanting to do for a long time and that is go to work and helping animals out as a Veterinarian. If there was a program to only focus on Veterinarian medicine I would do that instead as I believe having a focus on something would greatly increase the improvement of learning and understanding of a subject. Another reason why I am here is that I rather take Physics 2 than Calc 2 because it feels better to take and not only that, but to me it is way more interesting. Physics to me also is fun and not ""hard,"" but its like the concepts are fun, but the work is hard.
