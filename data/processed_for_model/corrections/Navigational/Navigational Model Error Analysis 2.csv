Why am I here in my room doing school work instead of on the campus? The answer is simple, I am here in my room doing school work because of the ongoing pandemic. This pandemic didn't need to happen if our politicians weren't so concerned about themselves and their wealth. They should have listened to the scientist to make sure everyone in the country could be safe, but instead they chose to ignore them and tell us the people to ignore them as well. Now the school season has started back up and some schools want kids to come back to class while others are doing distance learning. While the distance learning is good and it keeps everyone safe, it has it's complications if some students don't have the proper equipment, and opening schools back up for kids is a very bad idea since kids could spread the virus to others.""]",0,Reviewed; no issues found.,True,0

But then for so long I struggled with school, with wanting to finish school etc. I still have about two semesters left, it has been a different experience for me going from community college to sfsu. I was able to finally get good grades, even in the classes that I wasn\'t good at and just feel comfortable where I am at. Something that motivated me was that in chemistry in community college, I did horribly at, so at sfsu I was frightened that it would be the same but I actually did very well in my chemistry classes, and I was a chemistry learning assistant for a semester and my instructor even said I should minor in chemistry! Words I never thought I\'d hear. That kept me going and really motivated me to keep doing well. The next semester my instructor in PreCalc told me to minor in math! Also something I didn\'t ever think Id do.']",0,Reviewed; no issues found.,True,0
