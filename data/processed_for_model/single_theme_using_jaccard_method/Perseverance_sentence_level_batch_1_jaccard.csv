Alma ID,Essay: Why I am here?,Perseverance
S18.W2.111.01.04,"I am here at SFSU because I am a first generation student and I want to break the cycle in my family of not going to college. School has always helped me escape the hard things I live through everday. As the oldest of 3 siblings, I want to be a role model and set a good example for my siblings. I have always valued my education and I think its definitely the most important thing in my life. I want to help my community while I'm here and become a better version of me.",School has always helped me escape the hard things I live through everday.
S18.W2.111.01.15,"- I am here to expand my knowledge of the world around me and to converse with my peers to grow as a person.
- I am excited to be here in SI because I get to give my students and peers what my SI facilitators have given to me: A safe place. A place to learn, to make mistakes, overcome challeneges, and that is safe for them to be themselves and to meet others.
- I am here to learn myself. This is a new adventure for me where I will make mistakes and learn from them. I am here to learn from my students/peers and to grow from their feedback/advice.","A place to learn, to make mistakes, overcome challeneges /%/ This is a new adventure for me where I will make mistakes and learn from them."
S18.W2.111.01.20,"Why am I here? Good question. I'm here because I want to become a doctor in the near future. I want to save lifes. I'm the first one in my family to go to college and even though it's taken me longer than I had hoped, I'm almost there. I don't want to give up because this is something that I really want to do. I'm here because I have a dream and I will accomplish it. I struggle and don't understand everything right away. It takes me time but I get it eventually.

F18.SCI111.03.03,"The reason why I am here is because I want to achieve more out of life. I started working right out of high school and it took me a few years to really gain the motivation to go back to school and transfer from my community college. Initially, my motivation was very revolved around myself and proving others wrong, but eventually that motivation bloomed into proving to myself that I can and will continue to improve myself not only through school, but through life as well. I am taking this sci class (aside from the fact that it is mandatory for me), because I really need that extra push to set aside time to focus on strengthening my knowledge in physics. Although I am not a physics major, I need this class and physics 2 in order to get my undergraduate degree. I am also here for my family; more specifically my parents, but my entire family has been such a solid support system for me that I need to do this for them too. My parents have never forced me to do anything I didn’t want to do, but always supported the career choices or academic choices I decided on.","Initially, my motivation was very revolved around myself and proving others wrong, but eventually that motivation bloomed into proving to myself that I can and will continue to improve myself not only through school, but through life as well."
F18.SCI111.03.05,"This is my second time taking physics. The first time I took it was two semesters ago and I failed the class. (I got an A+ in the lab) While my teacher was very smart, she was new to teaching and I think she was very bad at it. She did not know how to teach the students in a way that we would be able to learn the concept. My professor would go extremely fast, and would assume we know the concepts we previously learned in high school. While I know that pre calculus is a prerequisite for this class, she did an awful job at explaining the concepts. I went to her office hours but everytime I would go, she would talk down upon me, so I stopped going after about 4 visits and went to CARP instead.unfortunately CARP wasn't too helpful because the tutors didn't really know what we were learning in class and therefore, even after looking at my notes, didn't really teach the concept to me. I studied a couple times with people in my class but not enough. I think everyone was a little lost in my class.  After the first exam, only 6% of the class passed with a grade of D or higher. I should have dropped the class, it was a very frustration experience, but I waited it out because I thought that if I studied enough, went to office hours enough, that I would pass. This semester I want to prove to myself that I am smart and capable of passing this class with an A. I want to actually learn the concepts and not come into class everyday confused and lost. I hope that this supplemental class will introduce me to new people to maybe from a study group with. I also hope that The supplemental class will enforce what we learn in class and help me better apply formulas to the word problems we have for homework.",This is my second time taking physics.

F18.SCI111.03.07,"I decided to take Sci 111 because I struggled with physics in high school. I barely managed to pass high school physics and I felt I learned nothing. I am someone who loves interacting with people, and I like working in groups. I feel like it is much easier to find a solution to a problem if lots of minds are put together. Sci provides the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of students who all come from different backgrounds, who all bring different perspectives and ideas. I hope to pass physics this semester but most importantly I hope to understand the concepts I am learning. I enjoy learning new things everyday. I am someone who is very curious and has always asked questions. I guess I try to understand the world around me and understand how things work. Science is a subject I have always found interesting, but difficult. It was not until, I started college that I realized my passion for biology, and decided to major in biology. I used to always be a quitter, and very early on in high school I decided that I was not smart enough to understand science but I have learned that dedication, passion, and hard work are key.","I used to always be a quitter, and very early on in high school I decided that I was not smart enough to understand science but I have learned that dedication, passion, and hard work are key."
F18.SCI111.03.11,"  I chose to be in this class because no matter how smart you are, no matter how much you know in the course you think you are doing the best at, there is always room for improvement. There’s always space to open your doors for more room for knowledge. I am all about learning and wanting to do better and better in all that I do and I know this course is perfect for that. I know it is called a “supplemental” course to help us do better in a certain class, but I like how it is open to everyone even if you get 100% on every exam or quiz or whatever it is that you do in that class. Another reason I am here is because I want to be able to help others by learning something myself. I feel like this opens opportunities to be friends with someone who is on the same path as you and this is an easy way to get to know others around you and to be able to surround yourself with others who are just like you. I am very grateful and blessed to even be able to take such a course.","I chose to be in this class because no matter how smart you are, no matter how much you know in the course you think you are doing the best at, there is always room for improvement."
F18.SCI111.03.19,"I am here because one I never took this in high school so I was new to physics and two I am retaking this class. I have found physics to be very difficult and I am hoping this class will help me pass physics. I don’t want to fail again and I also would like to understand it. I know it’s important to know on the MCAT. I want to be able to know about some physics to help me pass that test. I also think this class is a good opportunity to create study groups and make new friends in my major. You learn more when you teach others how to do something or if you’re learning by another student who is taking the same class. I also feel like it was a good idea for me to take this class because it will help me understand physics a lot better. Physics isn’t an easy subject to learn. A lot of people have told me they had to retake it. It is my weakness in school. I am a big fan of math but for some reason physics doesn’t stick to my brain. I’m hoping this time around, it will work out for me.",I have found physics to be very difficult and I am hoping this class will help me pass physics
 F18.SI.111.04.01,"Throughout my entire life I have dreamt about working in the medical field. I am here to make those dreams come true. It started as one of those careers that elementary school kids talk about when their teacher asks them what they want to be in the future, and my answer was always a brain surgeon, because how awesome does that sound. But this dream ended up sticking with me for the duration of my educational career and is the reason that I am attending San Francisco State today. Unfortunately I no longer want to be a brain surgeon, but I have finally decided that I want to study anesthesiology. I find the field to be very interesting to me and I can see myself enjoying it for the rest of my life. However, I need to make it through a long hard path of schooling to chase this dream. Throughout my educational career I have easily succeed in biology and chemistry courses because they comes naturally to me. Math always gives me a little trouble, but I get a hang of it after pushing myself to do the best I can. But then there's physics. I have never taken a physics course in my life and it makes me very anxious because there are a number of people that have seen what we are covering previously and I have never seen any of it. This is why I decided to sign up for SCI 111 and receive the extra help I knew was necessary in order for me to pass this class. I have heard nothing but good things about these classes, and so far what I have heard is true. I am here to build off of what we learn in class, ask questions about topics that I am not understanding, and to build study groups/relationships with my fellow peers. Looking forwards to a great and productive semester. ","Math always gives me a little trouble, but I get a hang of it after pushing myself to do the best I can.

 F18.SI.111.04.02,"I am in this class because I am not good at math. I have been in a sci class before for chemistry 1 and it helped me almost get an A in my class. I know physics is very math heavy and conceptually confusing, so I knew sci would be perfect for me this semester. I also have to take physics 2 next semester so I would like to have a firm understanding of the basic concepts before they get even more complicated. This class is a great way of studying and making friends that I can study with! I have already made a group to study with, we all have different teachers and can help each other figure out things one teacher might have focused on more than another. This class also allows us to concentration on the topics we did not understand in the class. It allows us to dig deeper into each subject and truly understand the things we might have missed before. I hope that by the end of this semester that I can get a better grade than without the sci classes help, and be able to go into physics 2 with confidence and the knowledge needed to do well there as well. (And if not I will just come back to sci and get some extra help) ","I am in this class because I am not good at math. /-/ I know physics is very math heavy and conceptually confusing, so I knew sci would be perfect for me this semester.

 F18.SI.111.04.03,"I am in the Physics 111 supplemental course because I had failed Physics 111 in the past spring semester. The reason of this is because I began to slack off towards the end of the semester because I was barely coasting by the course with a decent grade and as the course became harder and the longer I did not reach out for help. I ended up just giving up on passing the class. I am in SCI 111 so I can keep myself motivated to do better, improve, and gain a better understanding on what is going on in my Physics class. I am in SCI so I can meet people that have the same goal as me, which is to pass the class and understand it well enough to pass Physics 121. I would like to get to know more people in the class so that we can form a study group and not only study but complete homework together as well. I hope that through SCI I will also be able to grow as an individual. In this case I am referring to not being afraid of asking for help when I desperately need it. This is because math and science has usually always clicked with me and because physics does not click in my head automatically without lots of thinking I become stressed and worried that I will never be able to understand the material enough to pass the class.

 F18.SI.111.04.13,"Since I have no experience with physics whatsoever, I decided to take SCI 111. I didn’t have a chance to take it during high school and for some reason I feel left behind because of this. Physics is difficult for me and I need all the help that I can to fix my struggle with it. I have so much to study for physics 111 even though the school semester just started. I need help with even the most basic parts of physics. Hopefully, this class can help me overcome my problems and would prepare me for future exams. I mainly need to focus on the formulas that are used and my problem solving skills. I believe that SCI 111 will help me get there. I’ve only been into one class of SCI 111 so far and it is definitely helpful. I was guided to solve problems correctly and more efficiently after just one class. Since this experience, I feel that this class is useful and a privilege for those who are taking physics 111. I hope that this class will not only help me study on my exams, but to also help with homework problems. I tend to have a lot issues when it comes to the homework so hopefully taking this class would help me with that as well.","Physics is difficult for me and I need all the help that I can to fix my struggle with it. /-/ Since this experience, I feel that this class is useful and a privilege for those who are taking physics 111.

 F18.SI.111.04.14,"Why am I here? Well I am a recent transfer student coming from Palm Desert Area and decided that I was coming to SFSU late (early-mid august) so I didn't have much time to pick my classes. I am using this as a class to maintain the proper amount of credits to keep my financial aid. I also have had some struggles with college level math classes in the past because of the homework so I thought it would be a good idea to take a supplementary class because of the extensive math involved in understanding physics concepts. I think that using this as a class to study the material will make the homework easier and less of a ""chore"" to do. I also think that having a group of people from different sections learning from different professors is great for tackling a problem using different points of view. I have already used the knowledge of my peers in this SCI class to solve a problem I was not familiar with. It is also helpful for those who understand a concept to aid in teaching their peer what they know because if someone is able to explain something, they truly understand the concept behind it.

S19.SCI111.01.06,"I joined SCI 111 because I was in SCI 230 and 240 and it did help me while I was both in BIOL 230 and 240. I was a bit lost going into biol 230, I wasn’t sure what I was getting into and seemed pretty intense, and in-your-face in the teaching aspect, so when hearing about SCI I knew I needed to sign up. I’m really glad I did. Being in that class and hearing the instructors focus in topics we were unsure about whether it was in the videos they posted on ilearn, or the kahoot games, or the practice tests we were given before an exam really helped me to have a better understanding of what was going on in the course. It was also great with how the class itself interacted, were if there was anything someone comprehended really well they would try to explain it in another way that we weren’t told in lecture, or even by the instructors, so there was a variety of ways to break down the information for whomever needed it. Though, I feel like the biggest help would have had to have been the study sessions the instructors graciously coordinated and lead for us right before we walked into an exam. They truly went above and beyond with helping us know that we were in fact ready to take on anything this course had to throw at us. I was looking for something similar with PHYS 111, so that’s why I’m here.  ",I was a bit lost going into biol 230 /-/ so when hearing about SCI I knew I needed to sign up
S19.SCI111.02.01,"I am here in this world to make an impact. I am here to make a change in the world. I want to make an impact in this world, even if it is a small dent. My life goal is to go to medical school and become a doctor and eventually do medical research. I want to do medical research on miscarriages. By me being here in school and pursuing a career in the medical field I feel like I can make a huge impact by reducing the numbers of miscarriages and change the statistics of it. However, that is not the only medical research I would do, I would love to do more than that, that’s why I am here. Not only am I making an impact on the medical field and women who are pregnant, but I am also changing the STEM norms. I am here to change the number of women in STEM, to change the number of Latina women in STEM. I am also here to make my parents proud.

S19.SCI111.02.04,"I am here to obtain a better understanding of basic physics concepts from the Physics 111. In doing so, I can get a better grade in my current physics 111 class and boost my GPA, making myself a more competitive medical school applicant. Further, with a solid foundation in physics, I can get a higher score on the MCAT exam. I hope that through the SCI course, I bring my grade in the parent class up to an A. With a strong foundation in physics, I can also hope to be a better physician in the future as I will have a more developed understanding of motion and how the body moves. A more comprehensive understanding of kinesiology through physics should prove to be useful throughout med school as well as beyond. Mostly, I am in this SCI class so that I can get the best mastery of Physics 111 topics and raise my GPA. Without ever having taken a physics class, I do have some anxiety about the new material and applying complex math to some of the material. I am confident that by studying and working with the SCI class that I may feel more confident in the topic.

S19.SCI111.02.05,"I think I'm in this specific class to help with my understanding with physics. I almost always need extra help when it comes to mathematic heavy classes after high school. I made the mistake of not taking a sci class when I was in Calculus, and my grades suffered from it. I did not want to take any chances with physics so I made the decision to receive extra help. I'm also in this class to discover what I really want to do for the rest if my life. I'm not entirely sure if I want to remain in the science field and I'm hoping that I'll find a reason to either stay for leave as I explore more classes. I originally wanted to study zoology and become a zoologist, but my confidence and passion for the goal has diminished over the years. I'm hoping that I'll find a reason to stay in the science field, because I dont really know what else to do. Every other field of study that I show interest in is laughable in the eyes of everyone I know, and I kind of feel like I'm stuck in science whether I like it or not.

I figured that if I felt like I created a little community with the supplemental course, I would feel more comfortable with physics problems. With a community I would feel comfortable enough to ask questions without having to worry about sounding unintelligent.

SCI 111.01.11,"Why am I here? Why am I attending San Francisco State University? The answer to that is obvious which is to obtain a higher education so that I can pursue a career in the field of medicine. The field of medicine is not my dream job, however, having been able to work in the field as a medical assisting I did enjoy working in the healthcare field. I also know that obtaining a high paying career and actually doing something you enjoy a great path to success. Why am I in this supplementary instruction class? Well, in order for me to achieve the above mentioned goal, I must first get through these science and mathematics classes. I know for a fact that I am not very skillful at doing mathematics or anything quantitative. I could probably take on Physics without take a supplementary class, but taking physics along with chemistry, calculus, and biology during the same semester is rather risky.

I typically struggle with science courses, especially physical science courses with alot of conceptual material so the benefit of asking questions that I have for physics in a small group environment gives me more confidence in general. Another reason that I am in the SCI course is to get a class unit so that I may be eligible for competition in my sport. It is really beneficial that this course functions as a tutoring session and provides units as credit for spending time in the class. As an athlete, having time to study can be hard to manage sometimes so going to SCI once a week acts as a review for a week. I find it super helpful that SFSU provides resources for students to have extra practice and aid to solidify knowledge of certain classes . These resources give students many options to excel in their school work.","I typically struggle with science courses, especially physical science courses with alot of conceptual material so the benefit of asking questions that I have for physics in a small group environment gives me more confidence in general "

When this semester began, I quickly realized that it was quite the opposite. I found that I was really good at Calculus and I was struggling to understand Physics. I also realized that taking Physics and Calculus at the same time was a terrible idea since they teach about the same topics, but the way you work the problems and the answers are completely different. After a couple weeks into the semester, I thought I would give a SCI class a try. I thought it couldn't hurt anything and it would just be an extra study session that I would get college credit for. I am also here because I plan on majoring in BIO with a concentration in Zoology. For BIO majors, we need to take Physics 111 and then if we want to, we can build off of it and proceed to the next level of Physics. Since I will need to perhaps take another class of Physics after this semester, I wanted to fully understand the material as opposed to just completing the material so I can just complete the class.

But at the same time, I am very interested in physics as a whole. I love the fact that physics breaks down the every day forces that we take for granted every day. I am excited to study what makes the physical world work and can’t wait for this class to shed some insight into how the physical world around me.

If I had classmates that didn’t really care about the assignment at hand and did something else the entire time, then it would be very difficult for me to work as hard as I do on the various experiments with other people. Now for the question of why I’m here, if you want a clear and concise answer, it’s most likely due to the fact that it’s a part of the GE requirement for the school and if i don’t complete it, then I won’t be able to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in Biology. Another reason would be that I can see how my lab partners work on the assignment, and that in turn motivates me to work harder than them to get it done as fast as I can while still following the requirements of the experiment. The class is much easier than I expected it to be, however it’s only the first month of the class, so it’s bound to get harder sometime soon.

Computers have always fascinated me and especially growing up in Silicon Valley it feels like that's where most of the jobs are heading. Earlier in life I couldn't decide what I wanted to major in but recently computer majors have expanded beyond computer science which was the catch all of the computer degree. Computer Engineering degree is the perfect balance between the software and the hardware of the computer. For a bachelor's in Computer Engineering, part of your requirement is Physics with calculus 1 and Physics with calculus 2. Since computer engineering is also an engineering degree its requirements are very similar to electrical engineering which means all the same science class.
