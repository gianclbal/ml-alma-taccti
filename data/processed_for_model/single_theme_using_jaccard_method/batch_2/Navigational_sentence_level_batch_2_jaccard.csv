so the reason why i want to go into a stem major is because i have always been passionate about the sciences since i was a child.,['So the reason why I want to go into a STEM major is because I have always been passionate about the Sciences since I was a child. I have always been fascinated by how things work and the inner mechanics of anything that has a motor or gears. Like I still remember as a kid I spent all my money on Lego sets and RC cars and I always liked building and modifying to make it better by trial and error. Currently I am an automotive technician and Ive always been into cars because of my father. Also I just really want to invent something that will benefit society one day but in reality I just want to design and recreate something out of scratch and build it better.

I started undeclared and for my first 4 semesters basically just did GE classes. I started to lean towards criminal justice because I come from a decent military family and was thinking I could find my way into a federal field. I was never big on English class in HS and coming here and realizing that my major was just going to be a one essay after another, I couldn't do it.

I am majoring in biochemistry, because I feel like it will be helpful for me before I get into medical school. I want to get into medical school not to make anyone proud even though it is a plus, but I want to do it for myself, because I have seen many MD in different positions in the medical field doing their job and they even show me things that sparks my curiosity and interest even more in science so it just make sense for me to go to medical school, because that is where there are hands on learning of different positions of the medical field.""]",0

i like that you are doing the powerpoint and lecture.,['I am in Physics II (PHYS 122) because first of all I am a premed student. Not only that this class is a requirement for my major but also physics is in fact come to play in our everyday life.'],0
our lecture class doesn't do that or maybe i'm just having trouble understanding the lecture.,['I am in Physics II (PHYS 122) because first of all I am a premed student. Not only that this class is a requirement for my major but also physics is in fact come to play in our everyday life.'],0

I plan to get my doctorate degree in physical therapy. I used run track until my freshman year of college and with that experience I was able to see PTs at work and I fell in love. I initially was planning on going into athletic training but two semesters ago I decided to go full throttle. Im here in PHYS 112 to complete my requirements for graduate school! After SFSU, I plan on taking a year to catch up on all my requirements and also get more hands on experience.']",1

i am taking this class mainly because it fits with my schedule and i need it for my requirements.,['I am taking this class mainly because it fits with my schedule and I need it for my requirements.'],1
the particular reason why i specifically chose a physics course rather than other science courses is because i wanted to kind of witness the application of calculus in the real world at a much higher level than how the applications were taught in calculus.,['I am taking this class mainly because it fits with my schedule and I need it for my requirements.'],0
in mathematics we are just basically given the equation already and just plug in numbers.,['I am taking this class mainly because it fits with my schedule and I need it for my requirements.'],0
for example the equation for an object throw (the parabola) is just given such as something like 16t2 8t 32.,['I am taking this class mainly because it fits with my schedule and I need it for my requirements.'],0
which just gives us the ability to calculate the velocity or acceleration of the thrown object at a given time but i do not necessarily know how to arrive at the equation if we were to actually perform the experiment in real life.,['I am taking this class mainly because it fits with my schedule and I need it for my requirements.'],0

I don't want a B in Bio 230, I want at minimum an A since this is a required course for applying to grad school. And not only do I want to get the grade, but I want to understand the material so I can apply it to my future career in Physical Therapy (hopefully!). While i might not need to specifically known translation and transcription or anything like that for my specific career goals, it'll give me the background I need to be good at my job. SCI 230 is meant to help me achieve these goals and if I didn't take this supplemental course and I ended up finishing the semester with less than an A, I'll never forgive myself for not taking advantages of the opportunities provided for me.""]",0
