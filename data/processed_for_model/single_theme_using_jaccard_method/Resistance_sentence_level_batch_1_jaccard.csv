S19.SCI111.01.10,"I am here because I always wanted to be involved in the STEM field ever since I have been a little kid.

Another reason why I am here is that I would be the first in my family to be able to go to college and pursue a degree in biology. Also, I am an African American male, and there is not a great representation in the STEM fields, and  I want to help change that perception. Eventually, when I attended high school, I was apart of an internship at the California Academy of Sciences as an education intern who would teach people about the various scientific topics that are discussed here. During my time there, I started to get more involved with the many biology departments which allow me to set up mentorships with the researchers to develop a love for biology because I have an interest in learning how biology works for the creation of all things that are living on the planet."," I am an African American male, and there is not a great representation in the STEM fields, and I want to help change that perception."
