I am here in this class specifically because it's been almost six years since I've been in a Physics class and I know I am going to need all the help I can get.

I hope to receive a lot of practice problems, since I learned better by doing than just watching. I also really want to understand the basic concepts of physics, because I will be taking physics 2 next semester. Since I have never taken any kind of physics class, the topic does kind of scare me, and knowing that it’s based on algebra, trigonometry, and geometry does make me nervous. Even though physics it not necessarily part of my biology major, I do believe it explains a lot of what happens in the universe. It’s also comforting that people are in the same boat as me in needing additional help. To be completely honest, I prefer just sitting down in groups and try to work on the problems together rather than moving around from table to table. Focusing on problems with a small amount of people feels more productive to me personally. Basically my main point in being in this class is to get more practice in and to make me less nervous in solving certain problems.

I am taking this sci class (aside from the fact that it is mandatory for me), because I really need that extra push to set aside time to focus on strengthening my knowledge in physics. Although I am not a physics major, I need this class and physics 2 in order to get my undergraduate degree. I am also here for my family; more specifically my parents, but my entire family has been such a solid support system for me that I need to do this for them too.

F18.SCI111.03.04,"Why am I here? I guess that's a question I ask myself pretty frequently. Not in the literal sense of ""Why am in this class."" The answer to that is simple, If i'm in SCI then I'll probably get a good grade in physics and a good grade in physics translates to a good GPA, and that will matter when I want to go to med school. But in more of a metaphysical sense... like why are WE here, and I think that is a question that does require more thought. Why do we exist? In the grand scheme of things we're tiny insignificant particles in this potential multiverse... you might not even be the BEST version of YOURSELF. But still we or I continue to act like these smaller things seem to matter. And my theory for that is that we DO exist for a reason. We exist because we have the potential to create great change. Think about it geniuses like Einstein or Sports phenoms like Lebron James matter to US. Even though they have nothing to do with us we admire them because of their will and their potential to or ability to do things we hadn't seen before. That is what I believe the purpose of humanity is, to have the potential to change and ultimately live up to that potential is probably THE MOST IMPORTANT thing anyone can do. And because of that I believe the reason we exist is or the reason we are ""here"" is to live up to our potential.","If i'm in SCI then I'll probably get a good grade in physics and a good grade in physics translates to a good GPA, and that will matter when I want to go to med school.

So far, I’ve been learning better and have gotten a better grasp on how to solve problems and I’ve learned through explanation and by teaching other people myself. My class is a little slower paced, so the SI class gives me at the very least an introduction to a topic that we haven’t gone into depth on in my lecture. I’m here to make friends and a study group. I’ve noticed that this semester specifically I’m a lot more outgoing with talking to people. I’m not sure what it is, whether I’m more confident, or if I just don’t give as much of a shit. It definitely makes life a little easier, having classmates to talk to ant work with, or reach out for help outside of class. I have a pretty tight group of friends at home that I live with. We’ve been bros for a few years now, and we all work together and just mess around all the time. It will be nice to have friends outside of this group too. I wanted to take this SI class so that I can be more confident in my physics skills so that I don’t have to focus as much on my grades.

Sometimes I learn better when other people explain rather than teachers. And to be fair, I could use the extra boost for my GPA. My instructor quickly lists the main points of the topic and quickly moves to other topics. I find this ok but also not very effective to my understandment. I think sci would definitely enhance my learning abilities but also my academic self-esteem since I won’t be the only student struggling with the subject.  As the pace starts to pick up, I find Sci to be somewhat useful. There are things I haven’t learned and I found last sci class to be quite difficult.

 F18.SI.111.04.05,"I’m in SCI to better my understanding of physics. I took physics in high school and was absolutely in love, but as we all know high school courses are not the same as college courses. Chemistry has been kicking my butt since I first got to college and with that I was really afraid to start my physics requirements. So far into the course, I believe it’s a lot of visualizing, but chemistry is a lot of visualization as well so I believe I’m ready. I’ve took SCI in the past and realized it is also a really great way to make new connections from which you can form study groups or just friends in general. I’m really hoping to make more of those connections this semester. The professors for the SCI courses are usually good resources to help find programs as well or to even make the time to stay longer to help you with a problem.

 F18.SI.111.04.06,"I joined Sci for physics for many reasons. When I first heard the presentation in my physics class I found it super interesting. I knew I had to join this because it was my first time ever taking physics unlike many I never took physics in high school. In high school I had only taken chemistry and biology, however due to my major, Biology, I knew I needed to take all the sciences including physics. My main reason to take Sci like many other students, is so I could receive help for physics to do better in class. I like that I have time to review topics I did not understand in class and ask not only the tutors but peers as well. In addition, I joined because I would like to prepare for upcoming tests as groups and I like that I have a set time to actually sit and work. Personally, I have trouble making time and sitting down to study alone. Having Sci as a class with set times will really positively affect my learning and studying.

Having practice problems and discussions with fellow classmates about class material helps me to review class material that I may miss or not understand fully. I typically struggle with science courses, especially physical science courses with alot of conceptual material so the benefit of asking questions that I have for physics in a small group environment gives me more confidence in general. Another reason that I am in the SCI course is to get a class unit so that I may be eligible for competition in my sport. It is really beneficial that this course functions as a tutoring session and provides units as credit for spending time in the class. As an athlete, having time to study can be hard to manage sometimes so going to SCI once a week acts as a review for a week.

I decided to go into the SCI class because I was talking to my friend about it. We were both worried that physics would be harder than we expected and we both encouraged each other to take the SCI class for our respective physics class as a way to help ourselves. It’s my first SCI class so I’m still trying to see how this is structured and how I can make it work for me, because the SCI is designed to help me, but as I’m doing physics, I’m realizing that there’s lots of different ways of seeing and understanding the concepts. Through this class, I hope I can figure out how I’m understanding the concept through other people’s perspectives and help. I also never made a study group within my classes.   This is the first time I’m within a study group that are not my friends, so I’m still getting used to how to communicate and help my classmates out, because we’re here trying to understand physics.

I also realized that taking Physics and Calculus at the same time was a terrible idea since they teach about the same topics, but the way you work the problems and the answers are completely different. After a couple weeks into the semester, I thought I would give a SCI class a try. I thought it couldn't hurt anything and it would just be an extra study session that I would get college credit for. I am also here because I plan on majoring in BIO with a concentration in Zoology. For BIO majors, we need to take Physics 111 and then if we want to, we can build off of it and proceed to the next level of Physics.

Listening to what they were study seemed interesting and to learn about the law of physics was in intriguing. Last semester I decided to take physics to complete another prerequisite and I signed up for the lecture. I did not realize that the physics also had a lab class that goes along with it until I saw the road map from the biochemistry department. I then signed up for physics lab on Mondays because I wanted to take the lecture and lab at the same time. I then learned in the beginning of this semester that in order to take the lecture, you have to be in the lab at the same time. I was able to stay for the semester and take the physics lecture and lab. And that is why I am here.","Last semester I decided to take physics to complete another prerequisite and I signed up for the lecture.

In general, I would say that I am here because my parents both decided to emigrate to San Francisco; my father came from Lima, Peru; my mother came from Manila, Philippines. There is a certain pressure put upon many first generation children to thrive for the sake of the family. Iíve been thinking about that a lot these past couple years. I wonder how this pressure has affected my development, and in what ways (if any) do I plan to fulfill these generational wishes. Looking back, I would say this pressure to succeed for the family is a big part of why I studied STEM in college instead of the regular hobbies I had growing up: literature and music. It seemed like the responsible decision to make. The alternatives to being a scientist were to be a nurse, doctor, or a bit of a disappointment.          Granted, this sounds like a concerning motivation for education, but I must now tell you that I still felt a sense of agency in this decision. It was my decision to study microbiology specifically.

As an intro course I hope to learn the basics of learning how to calculate motion in objects and be able to do it confidently. Ever since I took physics in high school I became very intrigued by the concepts that exist all around us on earth. I really hope that this course will help me expand my understanding of physics by introducing new techniques like using calculus to solve problems.

If it is in the context of being in this physics lab, then I am here to complete a GE requirement. I am not too fond of physics, though it is quite an interesting subject to learn about. I thought while I am taking the main physics class, I should take the lab along with it. I did not take the lab that I could have while I was attending Biology class last semester. So, here I am now, taking this physics lab. So far, I am having some troubles with understanding some of the labs, which gets frustrating for me.

I would go out and practice during breaks or before and after those piano classes because it was something that I enjoyed doing. I can't imagine myself doing the same for this class, and I also don't even know where I would start.
