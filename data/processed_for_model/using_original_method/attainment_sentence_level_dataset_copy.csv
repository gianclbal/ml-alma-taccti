anyway i think astrophysics majors are so cool and so intelligent,['I really want to be a video gamer programmer and I know that physics is really important in that industry because of animation etc'],0
i feel like they just do math all the time which is what i do as well while i'm going about my life,['I really want to be a video gamer programmer and I know that physics is really important in that industry because of animation etc'],0
