"Why am I here? Well why does anyone pursue a higher education? to better one self and be able to succeed later on in life. Ever since I was little I wanted to be a doctor, so much so that I can't see myself doing anything else. I always wanted to be able to help people and I always had an intrest in medicine and the human body. I guess I here so I'll be able to help people in the future.",0,['0']
"I'm here because my parents came here during the vietnam war for a better life. I mean my mother wouldn't have been on a boat for 2 weeks for me to not work hard for a better life. She made a lot of sacrifices for me to be here. I guess you can say the same for my fathers sacrifices I am to be here as well.

"That depends how you define here. Why am I here in Sci 111? I'm here in Sci 111 because I want to successed in PHYS 111. More specifically I would like to be able to thrive not just survive. Why am I here at SFSU? The road to success was always college. You need to get a degree to get where you want to go. Specifically to me, my reasons for being here now have change. I'm now here to better myself whereas before it felt like I was blindly following. Why am I here in STEM? Hmmm.... I can't really think of where else I would be.",0,['0']
"I am here to better myself and hopefully give myself a better future. I am in this class because I want to pass physics and getting an A is part of that journey.

"I am here today because I skipped the lecture class and I need to come to SCi class to catch up what I missed today. Also, I am not good at math. I need to come to Sci class to help understand more in the lecture. I am in the SF state because I don't want to go out of the bay. It feels home when I study in SF state.",0,['0']
I am here in this class because I want a little extra help in my physics course. The reason I am taking physics is because it's a required course for my biology major. I am majoring in bio to get to my career goal of becoming a doctor or something in the medical field. The reason I came to SF State is because I wante to be in a new environment away from where I'm from (LA). I knew this step was going to be an important step in my life because I was the first in my family to go to college and especially away,0,['0']
"to make a better future for myself and ultimately the world, as cheesy as that sounds. Im a very passionate person and thats why im here, to put this passion into my school to later help people. Science is the only thing that makes sense to me sometimes.

"Because I'm stressed about physics and I have no idea what's going on in class. I'm taking this class to get a good grade in physics and to understand the material. I'm taking Phys 111 112 lab and lec. I have 3 labs a week so it's hard trying to understand all the material. All of my classes are super stressful and I have the busiest schedule of my life. On top of that I'm an RA as well so that's always stressful. Also I'm trying to transfer next semester so I'm trying to get all my classes together, make sure I have enough credits to get in. Also doubting if I'm good enough or smart enough to excel at all these things at once. My intelligence is always questioned anywhere I go or any class I'm in so it's hard to stay motivated or drive to succeed because you feel like you're not enough.",0,['0']
"I'm here because I want to improve my understanding in physics. I haven't taken a physics course since high school therefore I'm a little rusty.

This is why I'm here.",0,['0']
"I'm here at this institution becauase in order to do what I want to be when I grow up, I need a college degree. Planning to become a physical therapist requires a degree or some form of education. That is the main reason I'm here. Another reason why I'm here is because of the college experience. After graduating high school there are three paths a person might take: work immediately, enroll into the military, or go back to school. So, I chose to go back to school.",0,['0']

"Why am I here? Good question. I'm here because I want to become a doctor in the near future. I want to save lifes. I'm the first one in my family to go to college and even though it's taken me longer than I had hoped, I'm almost there. I don't want to give up because this is something that I really want to do.

"This is question is super vague. To start of, I am here in this world because my mom wanted a child, specifically a daughter. I am here in this school because I did not want to go in to debt after college so I chose to go to San Francisco State University and not University of California, Santa Cruz, like I wanted to. I got into other California State Universities as well, but I was more familiar with San Francisco State because I've done an art exhibition here once and I knew a bunch of people in my after school program from my middle school that I admire that went to San Francisco State and I knew it was a pretty decent school. I am here in this class specifically because it's been almost six years since I've been in a Physics class and I know I am going to need all the help I can get. I have taken SCI courses for my other science and math classes, and I have learned a lot from my SCI instructors regarding class material. Along with this, SCI is also an easy way for me to get an A and boost my GPA.",0,['0']
"I am in this Sci 111 class, because I have never taken physics in high school and I know that physics requires a lot of math in which I am very weak in. I hope to receive a lot of practice problems, since I learned better by doing than just watching. I also really want to understand the basic concepts of physics, because I will be taking physics 2 next semester. Since I have never taken any kind of physics class, the topic does kind of scare me, and knowing that its based on algebra, trigonometry, and geometry does make me nervous. Even though physics it not necessarily part of my biology major, I do believe it explains a lot of what happens in the universe. Its also comforting that people are in the same boat as me in needing additional help. To be completely honest, I prefer just sitting down in groups and try to work on the problems together rather than moving around from table to table. Focusing on problems with a small amount of people feels more productive to me personally. Basically my main point in being in this class is to get more practice in and to make me less nervous in solving certain problems.",0,['0']
"The reason why I am here is because I want to achieve more out of life. I started working right out of high school and it took me a few years to really gain the motivation to go back to school and transfer from my community college. Initially, my motivation was very revolved around myself and proving others wrong, but eventually that motivation bloomed into proving to myself that I can and will continue to improve myself not only through school, but through life as well. I am taking this sci class (aside from the fact that it is mandatory for me), because I really need that extra push to set aside time to focus on strengthening my knowledge in physics. Although I am not a physics major, I need this class and physics 2 in order to get my undergraduate degree. I am also here for my family; more specifically my parents, but my entire family has been such a solid support system for me that I need to do this for them too. My parents have never forced me to do anything I didnt want to do, but always supported the career choices or academic choices I decided on.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? I guess that's a question I ask myself pretty frequently. Not in the literal sense of ""Why am in this class."" The answer to that is simple, If i'm in SCI then I'll probably get a good grade in physics and a good grade in physics translates to a good GPA, and that will matter when I want to go to med school. But in more of a metaphysical sense... like why are WE here, and I think that is a question that does require more thought. Why do we exist? In the grand scheme of things we're tiny insignificant particles in this potential multiverse... you might not even be the BEST version of YOURSELF. But still we or I continue to act like these smaller things seem to matter. And my theory for that is that we DO exist for a reason. We exist because we have the potential to create great change. Think about it geniuses like Einstein or Sports phenoms like Lebron James matter to US. Even though they have nothing to do with us we admire them because of their will and their potential to or ability to do things we hadn't seen before. That is what I believe the purpose of humanity is, to have the potential to change and ultimately live up to that potential is probably THE MOST IMPORTANT thing anyone can do. And because of that I believe the reason we exist is or the reason we are ""here"" is to live up to our potential.",0,['0']
"This is my second time taking physics. The first time I took it was two semesters ago and I failed the class. (I got an A in the lab) While my teacher was very smart, she was new to teaching and I think she was very bad at it. She did not know how to teach the students in a way that we would be able to learn the concept. My professor would go extremely fast, and would assume we know the concepts we previously learned in high school. While I know that pre calculus is a prerequisite for this class, she did an awful job at explaining the concepts. I went to her office hours but everytime I would go, she would talk down upon me, so I stopped going after about 4 visits and went to CARP instead.unfortunately CARP wasn't too helpful because the tutors didn't really know what we were learning in class and therefore, even after looking at my notes, didn't really teach the concept to me. I studied a couple times with people in my class but not enough. I think everyone was a little lost in my class. After the first exam, only 6 of the class passed with a grade of D or higher. I should have dropped the class, it was a very frustration experience, but I waited it out because I thought that if I studied enough, went to office hours enough, that I would pass. This semester I want to prove to myself that I am smart and capable of passing this class with an A. I want to actually learn the concepts and not come into class everyday confused and lost. I hope that this supplemental class will introduce me to new people to maybe from a study group with. I also hope that The supplemental class will enforce what we learn in class and help me better apply formulas to the word problems we have for homework.",0,['0']
"I am here because i need help with subject and i dont understand how this class works. This whole time i wanna meet new people too because i dont wanna be alone in getting help. Umm to be honest with you i dont how to keep this up for another 150 words. My reason is pretty simple, but I can talk about the class so far its really cool. I really enjoy the energetic vibe of the class and how open everyone is as well. Also we are all helpful too like i feel comfortable the person next to me that im dumb and i dont get whats going on at all and be okay to someone that. Uhh the tutors are really cool and nice even though i forgot Casey name P.S. Im sorry Casey lol. Oh also thank you for the snacks i was really hungry and you guys came in clutch with the food too. This is super long i really have no idea what else to talk about soooo. I just need twentythree more wordseighteen now. This is really all i can think of right now as to why im here and additionally how its been going so far the past 3 weeks.",0,['0']
"I decided to take Sci 111 because I struggled with physics in high school. I barely managed to pass high school physics and I felt I learned nothing. I am someone who loves interacting with people, and I like working in groups. I feel like it is much easier to find a solution to a problem if lots of minds are put together. Sci provides the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of students who all come from different backgrounds, who all bring different perspectives and ideas. I hope to pass physics this semester but most importantly I hope to understand the concepts I am learning. I enjoy learning new things everyday. I am someone who is very curious and has always asked questions. I guess I try to understand the world around me and understand how things work. Science is a subject I have always found interesting, but difficult. It was not until, I started college that I realized my passion for biology, and decided to major in biology. I used to always be a quitter, and very early on in high school I decided that I was not smart enough to understand science but I have learned that dedication, passion, and hard work are key.",0,['0']
"I am here because I know I want to do well in this Physics class. I have had the same problem with school since I was a child and that is to stay focused on myself and my future. I tend to get so distracted by the fun things in life and forget that the hard stuff is what will define my future. I want to make sure that I take advantage of the blessing that is getting education. I am at a point in my life where I only have one goal and that is to do well in school, so that I can later go into a profession where I feel happy and satisfied with my life. My biggest fear is to be filled with regrets in old age. I would hate to have wasted the opportunity that is life. I still have a lot of power in my hands in terms of what I want to do with my future. So, I am here because I want to learn physics, get a good grade in physics, and excel in my studies so that I can one day go into the stem field and help other people. When I have done these things, I know that I will be content with the life that I lived.",0,['0']
"I am here because I am dedicated to my success in my STEM based courses. I am here because Im not afraid to ask for help and guidance. Im here because I want to be apart of a new community. I was apart of a SCI course last semester and I loved how helpful the instructors were. I felt comfortable with them and it gave me time to ask specific questions that I had and have something close to a one on one explanation. SCI allows a welcoming atmosphere where I can be helped by the instructors or my peers and we as a unit are able to solve problems. A lot of the time I feel uncomfortable Im my regular stem classes because I feel that I may be the only one not understanding. I also know that the time allotted for the professors are not enough to begin with. At the SCI classes, we usually go over worksheets that answer my questions. Im here because I want to be. You so know that the time allotted for the professors are not enough to begin with. At the SCI classes, we usually go over worksheets that answer my questions. Im here because I want to be. I am here for my parents and my family. I am here for my family members who could not make it this far. I here to show those family members that they can be here too. Im here for all the little colored girls who do not have positive figures to look up to in their communities.",1,['Im here for all the little colored girls who do not have positive figures to look up to in their communities.']
"I signed up for this SI class because this is the first physics class Ive ever taken. I figured that it would help me really understand the base concepts of physics. This gives me the understanding that Ill need should I decide to pursue further physics knowledge and give me the concepts that Ill need to know for my major. So far, Ive been learning better and have gotten a better grasp on how to solve problems and Ive learned through explanation and by teaching other people myself. My class is a little slower paced, so the SI class gives me at the very least an introduction to a topic that we havent gone into depth on in my lecture. Im here to make friends and a study group. Ive noticed that this semester specifically Im a lot more outgoing with talking to people. Im not sure what it is, whether Im more confident, or if I just dont give as much of a shit. It definitely makes life a little easier, having classmates to talk to ant work with, or reach out for help outside of class. I have a pretty tight group of friends at home that I live with. Weve been bros for a few years now, and we all work together and just mess around all the time. It will be nice to have friends outside of this group too. I wanted to take this SI class so that I can be more confident in my physics skills so that I dont have to focus as much on my grades. If Im not worried about my classes, then I can be even more supportive to my girlfriend. Shes trying to go to med school and needs all the help she can get. I want to be as supportive as I can for her. By taking the time to make sure that I dont fall behind in my classes, I can really make sure I can devote more time to helping her with whatever she needs. Im here to really learn physics so that I dont have to catch up later.",0,['0']
"I chose to be in this class because no matter how smart you are, no matter how much you know in the course you think you are doing the best at, there is always room for improvement. Theres always space to open your doors for more room for knowledge. I am all about learning and wanting to do better and better in all that I do and I know this course is perfect for that. I know it is called a supplemental course to help us do better in a certain class, but I like how it is open to everyone even if you get 100 on every exam or quiz or whatever it is that you do in that class. Another reason I am here is because I want to be able to help others by learning something myself. I feel like this opens opportunities to be friends with someone who is on the same path as you and this is an easy way to get to know others around you and to be able to surround yourself with others who are just like you. I am very grateful and blessed to even be able to take such a course.",0,['0']
"My name is student name. I am a dualmajor at San Francisco State University. My majors are philosophy and biology, with a concentration in physiology. I am eager to delve into research and development, using my biology, philosophy and risk management professional skills in lifesciences. I also like to rock climb and I teach rock climbing as well as an American Mountain Guide Instructor (AMGA). In my off time, I like to perform music with friends on stage and I have been playing guitar and bass for 13 years. I also really enjoy photography. I picked up photography from my dad when I was little and have been taking photos ever sinceits my way of journaling and I find it very therapeutic. In highschool I originally wanted to study theatre, but eventually joined a health academy and acquired 400 plus hours towards medical school interning as a student. Although I changed my direction career wise, I am asked to this day by students to act in their films and script readings at SFSU. It has been nice to find a balance in my hobbies and career goals this semester; The unexamined life is not worth living.",0,['0']
"I am here in the sci class because I would like to be pushed to dedicate time for focusing on physics. In the sci class, we do practice problems, and work that keeps me focused on physics. I am able to teach the concepts to other people and that makes me learn the concepts more as well because I am recalling them and using nothing to reference, but my brain, on what to do. I think I am also here because if I did not have a regular class to sit me down and do my work I would be less motivated and less likely to do it. This is because I prioritize what I want to do over my homework assignments because they tend to learn the concepts and feel of the homework is almost useless if I already know what I'm doing in prepared for the quiz or test for example. I do think practice and experience doing homework even if you fully understand the concepts is beneficial, but I don't spend my time unless forced to like a sci class. This class is a way for me to spend that time I need to further my success in the class and hold myself accountable.",0,['0']
"I don't know if this question is pertaining to why am I here at San Francisco State University or why am I here in this class. I am going to answer both. I am here at San Francisco State University because I wanted to be able to be far from home, but not too far. A one hour airplane trip back home, 7 hour drive. I wanted to experience a different environment and a different culture because not everything done in SoCal is done in NorCal. I am in college specifically to pursue my one and only career which is to be a veterinarian. Getting declined from UC Davis because they have a great vet program lead me over here where I can get my degree then try UC Davis later. I am here to get my degree, network, and to make great friendships. Why am I here in this Sci 111 course? I am in this course because I am new to physics I never took physics in high school because I was told it can mess up my GPA. Hearing that I already knew it would be a challenging course. I am in the course to get more help with understanding the concept and formulas of physics because the first class was very confusing and my professor teaches very fast. What I hope to get out of this Sci class is a clear understanding of how to solve and physics problem and be confident that I know how to do it.",0,['0']
"I am here because I am. My parents created me, I had no say in the matter, nonetheless I'm glad I happened. And so it just happens to be the case that I am here that's my answer to the why. Its sufficient to say that there is no direct reason for me being here, because I will never know the truth to this question. How can one know why they are here? For the sake of answering questions that might appear as a result of such an answer that I have provided; I will indulge thee with hypotheticals. People make claims based on their emotivist (emotional intuition if you will) beliefs that we are here because we have a purpose. This is a popular belief, but not derived from logic. I am not saying it is a wrong belief to have, this area of intelligence and it's true value are impossible to record by mankind which is saying something in itself. It may even be associated with a spiritual intelligence. However, similarly if you asked a dog to recite a poem in English you would come to the same conclusion it would. That is to say, we lack the skills to solve such a metaphysical question. The tools necessary in determining why I am here can only be answered in asking who caused me to be here, then, who caused my parents to be here, and so forth and so on. The real question isn't in the metaphysical sense (what I have been describing above), which is the deep question to why I am here. The real question is, what is your reason for being. I answer with, it is my being that gives my existence reason to be. In translation, my answer is relative to the context of my life to come, that the meaning behind my existence comes from what I do with it. To that my expectations are high, wish me luck. Also in the hilarious case that this question was specific to why am I in SCI 111; I am here to learn and be social.",0,['0']
"I am here for many reasons. One of the main reasons i am here is to get an education. After college i want to go onto medical school to become a neonatal surgeon. I can only achieve this dream if I have an education. I personally believe that an education is the key to success. Having an education opens up doors that you would not be able to access if you didnt have an education. Being here at San Francisco state gives me an opportunity to get an education. Secondly, I am here to make friends and experience new things. San Francisco is a really good place to explore new concepts and get to know new people. Finally I am here to find myself. Being away from home in a new city has taught me so many things especially about myself. I have learned that i am capable of more than i thought I was. I have learned a lot since being here and i cant wait to learn more not only about myself, but about becoming a doctor as well as learning new things in the world. I am very lucky to be at San Francisco state because not everyone is able to get a college education.",0,['0']
"Im not really sure what the question is asking. Im in this class right now because I am bad at physics and I knew I needed help. Im in San Francisco because I knew that it would be good for me to go to school away from home. This is my first year out of the dorms and living in a house with my friends and I feel so happy about that. It really is such a crazy feeling to know that I live in a house with only my friends and that we are responsible for keeping it clean and what not. This is also my first week of working a new job and it is fun because I work with some of my friends. It is all the way in the financial district, but it is worth it because everyone is super nice and I only work three days a week because they were so understanding about my school schedule. This past weekend I spent 8 plus hours a day in heels for recruitment and it hurt super bad but it was so worth being able to talk to all the girls and welcome new sisters. I am nervous for the upcoming weeks because that means I need to find a little and I know that comes with a lot of stress and crafting, which I will have to do with work and school. But, I am mostly excited because this should be a fun process.",0,['0']
"The reason for taking Sci is that I may be able to understand the concepts of physics and the subject itself to the best of my abilities. I have heard that the course itself is intense. I have never taken a physics class. With that being said, I find it important to take an hour of my time to attend this class so that I may fulfill my goals for physics. Sometimes I learn better when other people explain rather than teachers. And to be fair, I could use the extra boost for my GPA. My instructor quickly lists the main points of the topic and quickly moves to other topics. I find this ok but also not very effective to my understandment. I think sci would definitely enhance my learning abilities but also my academic selfesteem since I wont be the only student struggling with the subject. As the pace starts to pick up, I find Sci to be somewhat useful. There are things I havent learned and I found last sci class to be quite difficult. But there were als things I learned that were discussed later on the week. I look forward to learning and understanding physics throughout the semester.",0,['0']
"I am here because one I never took this in high school so I was new to physics and two I am retaking this class. I have found physics to be very difficult and I am hoping this class will help me pass physics. I dont want to fail again and I also would like to understand it. I know its important to know on the MCAT. I want to be able to know about some physics to help me pass that test. I also think this class is a good opportunity to create study groups and make new friends in my major. You learn more when you teach others how to do something or if youre learning by another student who is taking the same class. I also feel like it was a good idea for me to take this class because it will help me understand physics a lot better. Physics isnt an easy subject to learn. A lot of people have told me they had to retake it. It is my weakness in school. I am a big fan of math but for some reason physics doesnt stick to my brain. Im hoping this time around, it will work out for me.",0,['0']
"I an here at SFSU for 2 reasons. My family is very bug on education, so everyone generally aspires to go to college. I never thought I had an option not too. It was always in my head after K12, boom you go to college and become an ""adult"". For me personally, I am here to learn more about STEM so I can gain the tools to equip me for medical school. Career wise I'm not sure what I want to do, but I definitely want to work with medicine. The second reason why I am here at SFSU is because of my parents. I originally wanted to move to LA or San Diego, San Diego state was originally my first choice. Growing up I thought I could get into those top school's like Harvard, but my grades didn't reflect that. But why I ended up here at SFSU is because my parents didn't want me moving up to SoCal, and my only choices were school's up here. So I thought SFSU was the best school to go to out of those options. But overall, mainly I want to make a difference in the medical community and use my skills to help others.",0,['0']
"I am here to learn more about physics. I come here to achieve the skills needed to solve physics problems, all sorts. I need to be able to remember, comprehend, and manipulate various formulas. I come here to learn more about concepts that physics has in general. I also need physics to get into the medical school I want to get into, but I really enjoy physics and the challenging problems it brings. I am also here to get my general education done. Most importantly, I am here because I want to understand more about physics because my grandfather was a physics professor and also taught at UC Berkeley. I am here to understand measurements, calculations, and various types of problems that specialize in different laws of gravity. I am here to build a life for myself and am starting with getting a good grade in physics, and this class will hopefully enable me to do so. I am here to get a degree. I am here to enjoy my life in a part of the world that is still somewhat new to me. I am here because I want to experience adulthood and life on my own. I am here to start my life.",0,['0']
"I decided to take this class primarily to get a better grade in Physics 111; I have never attempted a physics class, so conceptually this is all very new to me. I always hear about people taking a physics class in high school; I wish I could have been that fortunate! I feel like being present in this class will help me better understand physics conceptually and mathematically. I do not have a strong background in mathematics; despite being given formulas I have a difficult time understanding the ultimate purpose of the formula, as in what it is meant to prove, and I end up getting confused and frustrated with the material. I hope my attendance will help with understanding the material and being able to correctly calculate the various problems. I also hope that attending this course will broaden my conceptual comprehension of physics. I do not want to be stumped on a problem because I cannot imagine what it is supposed to look like or what it is meant to represent. I am terrified of the upcoming exams in physics; I am hoping that coming to this class will help build my confidence and help me to understand how to look at the problems and determine what factors I need to answer the question.",0,['0']
"I'm here because I'm afraid of failing physics and I'm hoping this class will help me succeed in passing it. It's like this fear I have about failing classes after I failed like two classes. I also took my friend with me, Devin because we're in same physics class so I won't be alone. I also hope this class will help me understand physics more by just practicing more problems. I also want to meet new people so we can all study together and help each other. So far this class has been surprisingly fun and I actually learned a lot that helps me with the class. I learned how to manipulate the equations that will help me in physics. I actually meet some cool people so far, like name 1 and name 2. And I like how open we are and the teachers are really good. Name 3 and name 4 are also pretty cool, they're very open and will help in any way they can. Maybe this class will also help in my life in general, to do work harder and work with a group better. Basically, I'm learning some life skills with this class. Well yeah, that's pretty much it that's why I'm taking this class.",0,['0']
"I am here for a lot of reasons. I went into physics pretty confident that I was going to do well, but after the first class my confidence flew down. My professor mentioned something about a sci class when it first started but I did not even think about taking the class. It was not until someone came in our physics lecture and started explaining the sci course. The reason I did not think about taking it at first was because my professor did not explain it very well and I had never even heard of a sci course. When someone came in and started to explain what it is and how it can really help you out, I figured why not. It does not hurt to get extra help and honestly it is an easy A that is one unit. So, I scammed my friend to come with me to the first class because I did not want to go alone. I wanted to feel it out and see how the energy was. At first, I thought that I was not going to get the help that I needed, but the last class we had changed my opinion because it ended up being really helpful. I am glad I joined this sci course and excited to see how this year goes.",0,['0']
"Throughout my entire life I have dreamt about working in the medical field. I am here to make those dreams come true. It started as one of those careers that elementary school kids talk about when their teacher asks them what they want to be in the future, and my answer was always a brain surgeon, because how awesome does that sound. But this dream ended up sticking with me for the duration of my educational career and is the reason that I am attending San Francisco State today. Unfortunately I no longer want to be a brain surgeon, but I have finally decided that I want to study anesthesiology. I find the field to be very interesting to me and I can see myself enjoying it for the rest of my life. However, I need to make it through a long hard path of schooling to chase this dream. Throughout my educational career I have easily succeed in biology and chemistry courses because they comes naturally to me. Math always gives me a little trouble, but I get a hang of it after pushing myself to do the best I can. But then there's physics. I have never taken a physics course in my life and it makes me very anxious because there are a number of people that have seen what we are covering previously and I have never seen any of it. This is why I decided to sign up for SCI 111 and receive the extra help I knew was necessary in order for me to pass this class. I have heard nothing but good things about these classes, and so far what I have heard is true. I am here to build off of what we learn in class, ask questions about topics that I am not understanding, and to build study groupsrelationships with my fellow peers. Looking forwards to a great and productive semester.",0,['0']
"I am in this class because I am not good at math. I have been in a sci class before for chemistry 1 and it helped me almost get an A in my class. I know physics is very math heavy and conceptually confusing, so I knew sci would be perfect for me this semester. I also have to take physics 2 next semester so I would like to have a firm understanding of the basic concepts before they get even more complicated. This class is a great way of studying and making friends that I can study with! I have already made a group to study with, we all have different teachers and can help each other figure out things one teacher might have focused on more than another. This class also allows us to concentration on the topics we did not understand in the class. It allows us to dig deeper into each subject and truly understand the things we might have missed before. I hope that by the end of this semester that I can get a better grade than without the sci classes help, and be able to go into physics 2 with confidence and the knowledge needed to do well there as well. (And if not I will just come back to sci and get some extra help)",0,['0']
"I am in the Physics 111 supplemental course because I had failed Physics 111 in the past spring semester. The reason of this is because I began to slack off towards the end of the semester because I was barely coasting by the course with a decent grade and as the course became harder and the longer I did not reach out for help. I ended up just giving up on passing the class. I am in SCI 111 so I can keep myself motivated to do better, improve, and gain a better understanding on what is going on in my Physics class. I am in SCI so I can meet people that have the same goal as me, which is to pass the class and understand it well enough to pass Physics 121. I would like to get to know more people in the class so that we can form a study group and not only study but complete homework together as well. I hope that through SCI I will also be able to grow as an individual. In this case I am referring to not being afraid of asking for help when I desperately need it. This is because math and science has usually always clicked with me and because physics does not click in my head automatically without lots of thinking I become stressed and worried that I will never be able to understand the material enough to pass the class.",0,['0']
"The reason why I am here today, in this class is to get a better understanding of what physics is. This class, will help me strive and understand concepts that my professor has taught me during the week. If I do not understand a topic, then I would go to this class and ask my questions and get more help until I completely understand what is being taught. This class gives us more practice problems to help prepare us for exams and this is why I enjoy being there. I also am here because I know that I am not the only one who is struggling, and seeking help. When I am in that room, I feel comfortable to ask my questions without having anyone judge me because I did not understand a topic that was taught by my professor. When I am around my peers in that classroom, I sense a connection and I know that they want what I want, which is to understand physics and pass the class with a good grade. With all of this being said, I am here because I care for my grades and I want to be successful. I believe that this class will help me accomplish that task, and help me be more prepared for what is to come in the future.",0,['0']
"Im in SCI to better my understanding of physics. I took physics in high school and was absolutely in love, but as we all know high school courses are not the same as college courses. Chemistry has been kicking my butt since I first got to college and with that I was really afraid to start my physics requirements. So far into the course, I believe its a lot of visualizing, but chemistry is a lot of visualization as well so I believe Im ready. Ive took SCI in the past and realized it is also a really great way to make new connections from which you can form study groups or just friends in general. Im really hoping to make more of those connections this semester. The professors for the SCI courses are usually good resources to help find programs as well or to even make the time to stay longer to help you with a problem. Ive enjoyed all of my SCI courses and all in all just college too. Its been a great experience to see that even helping one student with their work could be very rewarding and I might think of becoming a SCI professor in the future as well.",0,['0']
"I joined Sci for physics for many reasons. When I first heard the presentation in my physics class I found it super interesting. I knew I had to join this because it was my first time ever taking physics unlike many I never took physics in high school. In high school I had only taken chemistry and biology, however due to my major, Biology, I knew I needed to take all the sciences including physics. My main reason to take Sci like many other students, is so I could receive help for physics to do better in class. I like that I have time to review topics I did not understand in class and ask not only the tutors but peers as well. In addition, I joined because I would like to prepare for upcoming tests as groups and I like that I have a set time to actually sit and work. Personally, I have trouble making time and sitting down to study alone. Having Sci as a class with set times will really positively affect my learning and studying. I think Sci is a really good program because they are up to date what teachers are teaching in lecture and continue reviewing those topics. Also, I see Sci as an opportunity to meet new people. I really enjoy this because I am a freshmen and have yet to adapt to the school. Overall, I am in Sci to extend my knowledge in physics, meet new people, and learn in a fun way.",0,['0']

"I am in this SCI class in the hopes of getting a really good grade in general physics 1. I am hoping for an A, and I honestly think it is doable because of all the extra time I am going to be putting in to make sure I understand all the concepts. It will also prepare me for general physics 2, which will hopefully help me down the road somehow when I am in pharmacy school. This is my first semester at SFSU, I am a transfer student from Southern California (Sylmar). I did not know what to expect for my first semester out here so I also decided to enroll in this course for safety measures just to make sure my first semester alone would go by more smoothly.. hopefully. I decided to come to SFSU to spend these last 2 years of my bachelors degree as focused as possible with no distractions to hold me back from reaching my goal. So far the school has been good to me other than the fact that all of my first exams fall on the same week. I plan on applying my full attention in class and going over the worksheets when I am home to further prepare me for my exam.",0,['0']

"I am here, in this class for a few different reasons. First, I took AP Physics in high school, so I thought I had a good grasp of things that would go on in class. In the original physics section I had, this was not the case. I thought I had a decent understanding of things each day, before going to class, but I found myself leaving class extremely confused. I believe this had a large part due to my Professor having a thick accent. So, I switched sections and added this supplementary course. This turned out to be a great decision. I can understand my professor much better now, so I am understanding the material much better and not struggling along. As for this supplementary course, I have only been in it for one class, and I already think it is my favorite class. I get extra practice and help to understand the problems I have difficulty with and just the material in general. I also have a great time in class, as it is fun to be there and actually enjoyable. This is not really the case for any of my other classes. This is why I am here and I am glad that I am.",0,['0']
"I am taking SCI to expand my understanding of physics. This is my first physics class I have ever taken and so far it has sparked my interest. I never understood the concepts behind phyiscs and now that Im in this class its becoming more and more clear. Understanding physics also helps me in understand other classes Im currently taking. It gives details on how the concepts in chemistry work and it also explain why the material I studied in precal and calculus is important. These different subjects are all related which makes learning them at the same time easier and also more fun. I can make analogies in my head easier and I can also explain what Ive learned a whole lot better. The hardest part of physics so far has been finding out where to start on a problem. Im hoping that SCI will help me to get started on complex problems which sometimes can scare me from the beginning. Also sometimes the physics question are really vague and I hope SCI can help clear them up for me. For a first time physics student, I sure feel confident that I will be successful in this course because SCI is very helpful and Im really interested in the material so far. Its been fun working through the problems and picturing the scenarios.",0,['0']
"Since I have no experience with physics whatsoever, I decided to take SCI 111. I didnt have a chance to take it during high school and for some reason I feel left behind because of this. Physics is difficult for me and I need all the help that I can to fix my struggle with it. I have so much to study for physics 111 even though the school semester just started. I need help with even the most basic parts of physics. Hopefully, this class can help me overcome my problems and would prepare me for future exams. I mainly need to focus on the formulas that are used and my problem solving skills. I believe that SCI 111 will help me get there. Ive only been into one class of SCI 111 so far and it is definitely helpful. I was guided to solve problems correctly and more efficiently after just one class. Since this experience, I feel that this class is useful and a privilege for those who are taking physics 111. I hope that this class will not only help me study on my exams, but to also help with homework problems. I tend to have a lot issues when it comes to the homework so hopefully taking this class would help me with that as well.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? Well I am a recent transfer student coming from Palm Desert Area and decided that I was coming to SFSU late (earlymid august) so I didn't have much time to pick my classes. I am using this as a class to maintain the proper amount of credits to keep my financial aid. I also have had some struggles with college level math classes in the past because of the homework so I thought it would be a good idea to take a supplementary class because of the extensive math involved in understanding physics concepts. I think that using this as a class to study the material will make the homework easier and less of a ""chore"" to do. I also think that having a group of people from different sections learning from different professors is great for tackling a problem using different points of view. I have already used the knowledge of my peers in this SCI class to solve a problem I was not familiar with. It is also helpful for those who understand a concept to aid in teaching their peer what they know because if someone is able to explain something, they truly understand the concept behind it.",0,['0']
"Last semester, about the time when Math 199 class was almost ending, I heard that the next step, Physics 111, would be much more tough than the current class. Since Physics 111 class is one of the requirements to graduate in my major, Kinesiology, there is no option to avoid the class. Therefore, I was expecting that if there would be a supplemental class for that, I really should take the class. I think it was the second day of physics 111 class of this semester, facilitator 1 came to our class and explained about SCI 111 class, in which I had a good impression of the class. He explained that the SCI class has a small community where students help and stimulate each other and work together. I was interested in studying in that kind of conditions because having study groups always helps me to learn contents that I did not fully understand or to notice my weakness. Also, it helps me to recognize how much I really understand or not. Furthermore, having someone to study with gives me more motivation than studying by myself. Because of these reasons I decided to take SCI 111 class during this semester. I hope I enjoy learning Physics.",0,['0']

"""Why Am I Here?"" is a question I ask myself everyday. I love college especially everything that it has to offer. But sometimes I just feel like changing my major because of many reasons.

So like how am I suppose to pick one concentration and follow through with it, if I love being involved with multiple things. That is why I ask myself this question. But at the end of the day, I try to take it day by day because I know I overwhelm myself with things. Another reason why I am in college is not only accomplish something for myself but to see my family happy! I am a big family person, and their literally everything to me. If it wasn't for my family specifically my siblings I know that I wouldn't be as motivated to keep going. I also like being an example for my brother because he thinks dropping out is an option.

I was a bit lost going into biol 230, I wasnt sure what I was getting into and seemed pretty intense, and inyourface in the teaching aspect, so when hearing about SCI I knew I needed to sign up. Im really glad I did. Being in that class and hearing the instructors focus in topics we were unsure about whether it was in the videos they posted on ilearn, or the kahoot games, or the practice tests we were given before an exam really helped me to have a better understanding of what was going on in the course. It was also great with how the class itself interacted, were if there was anything someone comprehended really well they would try to explain it in another way that we werent told in lecture, or even by the instructors, so there was a variety of ways to break down the information for whomever needed it. Though, I feel like the biggest help would have had to have been the study sessions the instructors graciously coordinated and lead for us right before we walked into an exam.

The amount of time in class that is given on the subject material is not substantial enough in my opinion, to allow for mastery of the material. However, these odds at success increase with the addition of this class into my schedule. The class provides help with my understanding of certain difficult topics. I have not taken a physics course in quite a long time so I feel as if I am at somewhat of a disadvantage when it comes to this class. My instructor is very good at answering questions in class. However, I do not feel confident in occupying all of her time with so many questions on the course material outside of her office hours.

I would like to do well in the course and I have heard that the supplemental instruction courses are very helpful and that students who take these courses, on average, do better in the actual class in comparison to students who dont take the sci course.

With that in mind, I am taking this course so that I not only pass my physics class but so that I can better understand the material and how to apply it to everyday situations. This course will also benefit me in case I decide to take the second physics course, physics 121, later on.",0,['0']
"I am here to obtain a better understanding of basic physics concepts from the Physics 111. In doing so, I can get a better grade in my current physics 111 class and boost my GPA, making myself a more competitive medical school applicant. Further, with a solid foundation in physics, I can get a higher score on the MCAT exam. I hope that through the SCI course, I bring my grade in the parent class up to an A. With a strong foundation in physics, I can also hope to be a better physician in the future as I will have a more developed understanding of motion and how the body moves. A more comprehensive understanding of kinesiology through physics should prove to be useful throughout med school as well as beyond. Mostly, I am in this SCI class so that I can get the best mastery of Physics 111 topics and raise my GPA. Without ever having taken a physics class, I do have some anxiety about the new material and applying complex math to some of the material. I am confident that by studying and working with the SCI class that I may feel more confident in the topic.",0,['0']
"I think I'm in this specific class to help with my understanding with physics. I almost always need extra help when it comes to mathematic heavy classes after high school. I made the mistake of not taking a sci class when I was in Calculus, and my grades suffered from it. I did not want to take any chances with physics so I made the decision to receive extra help. I'm also in this class to discover what I really want to do for the rest if my life. I'm not entirely sure if I want to remain in the science field and I'm hoping that I'll find a reason to either stay for leave as I explore more classes. I originally wanted to study zoology and become a zoologist, but my confidence and passion for the goal has diminished over the years. I'm hoping that I'll find a reason to stay in the science field, because I dont really know what else to do. Every other field of study that I show interest in is laughable in the eyes of everyone I know, and I kind of feel like I'm stuck in science whether I like it or not. Everything else feels out of reach, so hopefully, I'll find a reason to stay in science while enjoying what I do",0,['0']
I am here because i am a first generation student and I want to make my parents proud. I am so privileged to be able to be going to college and be able to further my education. I want to finish college and then go to Medial school and be able to become a OBGYN doctor! Helping woman and being able to help and see the a human be created and form is so amazing to me and I find it super interesting and i am hoping that being able to go to college and doing good in all my classes will help me with my dreams come true. I am very lucky to be in such an amazing school and that my parents are able to help me and support me every step of the way. My sister wasnt able to go to a four year so for my family me being in a four year school is amazing and the fact that Im the first from my family is amazing and I dont want to let them down. I am taking this class for extra help because i want to do really good and I want to be able to understand and pass the class with a good grade and actually understand it so that i can do good in the next physics class that i have to take in the future.,0,['0']
"I am here because I want to get a good grade if not an excellent one in my physics course. Im here to be more involved and focused on concepts that I am having a difficult time understanding, I am also here to work with students with different learning abilities and take them in as learning objectives for myself. I am here to not feel intimidated because I am involved in a class that is saying I need help and thats okay. I am here to learn from students and work with students in a classroom together to come to a better understanding of physics. My main goal for this class is to help me pass my class with a B or higher, I am taking this SI course to increase my ability to achieve this goal. Im hoping to meet more people affiliated with my major and be more involved with students who are willing to learn and experience more on campus. I'm really looking forward to this SCI class mainly to have a better understanding of physics ultimately. Im hoping by the end of this course I can take what I learned and use it in my next physics course.",0,['0']
Im here taking a Sci class for physics because I have never taken a physics class. I didnt know what to expect and I was actually really nervous to how well I was going to do. I knew what gravity and acceleration was before I came to the class but I knew physics had a ton of math and math isnt really my strong suit. I just wanted a space where I could ask questions when Im lost and be surrounded by people who are taking the same class as me. Im taking 17 units so I feel like I could get really caught up and get lost or slack in my classes so I took all the Sci classes I could so I could designate a for sure time to study for my class. I also heard good things about the Sci classes from people who took it last year and they said it really helped them understand physics more. I also heard you get credit for it and its just graded on participation so it was kind of a no brainer to sign up. I also like being helped by other students whove taken the class already because I feel like Sci instructors can explain things better than some professors.,0,['0']
"I decided to enroll into the physics supplemental course because Ive had a history of struggling in my math classes. Since physics is basically another math class, I knew I would need to take extra steps to ensure my success. In the past Ive had a packed schedule with classes and work, but this semester I allowed myself more room for school by cutting back my work hours. I originally planned on letting myself have time to attend office hours, but I realized that wouldnt be enough. When I heard the option to enroll in a supplemental course for physics, I knew I had to enroll for the extra help. Not only would I have more practice with physics problems, but I would be able to connect more with my fellow classmates. I figured that if I felt like I created a little community with the supplemental course, I would feel more comfortable with physics problems. With a community I would feel comfortable enough to ask questions without having to worry about sounding unintelligent. Another big reason for enrolling was when I heard I wouldnt have homework. I will have the opportunity to have the extra practice with physics problems without the stress of having to worry about my grade. I will be able to do the problems at my own pace and truly understand the steps to get the solution",0,['0']
"I am taking a SCI helper class to better understand what I am learning in class. I am taking both a Physics111 SCI course and Chemistry115 SCI course. I enjoy it because it is forced studying in a productive manner. I forgot where I read this, but many educators say for every unit you take you should be studying one hour per unit your class is worth. I am taking sixteen units therefore I should be studying sixteen hours a week. These SCI classes will help me accomplish that through, making myself accountable to go to class each week and get extra help. It is amazing review and reflection time on what we just learned in class. It also gives you an opportunity to ask any questions that you have, that you were unable to ask in class due to time. I also like hearing from different people on how they are learning the material because it might also help me. It is very helpful to have someone in the same shoes as you, since you are taking the class together it is a much better time to get to know your class mates and forum study groups. So far from the first three weeks four weeks of class I have gotten As on all my quizzes given in my main classes thanks to my SCI helper classes. I do not regret taking these classes at all, actually I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to take these classes.",0,['0']
"I am here because I want to have a successful future. I am here because I want to be able to give back to my family and my community. Most importantly, I am here because of my fiancee, Jordan. We were together for seven years since we were thirteen years old. He was my rock, my best friend, and my biggest supporter. Jordan passed away unexpectedly this year, on March 2nd, 2019. I took some time off school, and decided to come back the next semester (now) because school was always really important to Jordan, and i have been really focused on not letting him down. This year has been extremely long and challenging so far, and I am just trying to find my way back. Ive been making new friends in my new classes, and creating new study groups in my science classes which has really been a large help for me so far this semester. I have also been looking for science clubs to join in order to meet other people from my major. Nevertheless, from the day he passed, everything I do and will do will be for him. So, im here to complete school and walk across that stage for the both of us.",0,['0']
"I am here because I know that physics is hard and I knew that taking a sci course would benefit me to pass the class. Physics is a course that I need to take for my major and although I want to say that I will miss physics, the truth is I wont however, I know that in the long run having had the opportunity to gain knowledge of physics will help me in my future academic career. This far I have gained so much not just from physics but life as well. In a year I lost everything but now that I have come back, it almost feels as if I was meant to be here at this exact time in my life. No matter at what age I am in, I know that wherever I am in life it is because of my choices, God, and it is because I was meant to be there. That is why I am here, I am here for a reason that is beyond me and for the fact that I want to go to medical school and taking this class will help get there. Life works in mysterious ways and MANNN am I learning a whole lot. thank you.",0,['0']
"I am in this SCI class to get support for my PHYS 111 course. I have never taken a physics course and all I ever knew from physics was the information told to me by my friends. This in a way freaked me out because I had no expectations on how the course would go but I was worried I would not find success in the course. I have never been good at math before and when I started going to the first couple courses of PHYS 111, I saw the class as a math class but with more conceptual work as well. In the past, when I took precalculus, I went to tutoring at least three hours a week and that is the only reason why I passed the class with an A. I think it is important to force myself into situations where I need to focus and work on the subject I am not good at even if that means I am more exhausted by the end of the day. I am here hopefully to gain extra practice to make me more confident in my work and to prepare me for exams. I hope to be able to find classmates that would be down to build study groups and work together to find resources to help us succeed in the course as well.",0,['0']
"I am here because in my family it is expected of my brothers and I to go to college after we graduate from high school. My mom has a masters degree and my dad has a bachelors degree, so it was never a question of if we go to college. Our question was which college we are planning to go too. I am here in this class so that I can get extra practice of the topics that we learn from lecture. I am here at the school so I can get my bachelors degree for biology with a concentration in marine biology and limnology and get into a research lab. Then after I graduate, I am planning to go straight into the masters degree. My goal is to get into the RIPTIDES program for my Masters. My ultimate goal is to become a marine biologist and eventually get a Doctorates Degree. In order to become a marine biologist, you need at least a masters degree. Another goal is to study the effects that global warming, ocean acidification, and water pollution has on the marine animals. Also, I would want to study the animals behavior and how they interact with each other.",0,['0']
"I am in this class because I want a better grade in my class, I also want to get extra help so I can understand what I need to do rather than memorizing for the exams. Also, this is a 1 unit course so it's not that high but it's a very easy A in this class as long as I participate, but this class will help my GPA because I will have A in a 1 unit and this class will help my chem lecture grade be higher. This semester I am taking 18 units, so I have a lot of homework and classes and exams but taking SCI classes will help me get less stress about my exams and homework. I also have my study group since my freshman year so we help each other on anything so that's why I am able to take 18 units because of the help I have around. SCI is better than tutors because SCI helps more your GPA than tutors. SCI classes also help you make connections with people that might be in the same class or major. I will like more sections open because some of the classes time doesn't fit our schedule.",0,['0']
"I am attending science 111 to better understand the physics concept. I originally enrolled into this class because I had no prerequisite completed to enroll in Psychics 111, so I did the Aleks, but my professor recommended me to take this course for extra assistance. Now that I am in this course, I am happy to attend a class that helps me understand the concepts of psychics. It is a great place to breakdown problem by problem as we do not do this in the class lectures. I am not a physics major but instead I am a Child and Adolescent major. The reason I am enrolled in Psychics 111 was because I intend to attend medical college after attaining my bachelors degree and they have made Psychics a requirement. I am really glad that I joined this course for assistance because I usually have a hard time attending tutoring services as I have a hard time reaching out to people for help. I also have not taken a math course since freshman year and did not need it for my major, so I completely feel different worrying about a math exam which was not one of my concerns for the past three years. I really hope this class continues to help me prepare for a Physics tests as Physics has so many problems and many formulas attached to it. I have a hard time finding out which formula could be used to solve the problem and I am just really bad at math in general. I am looking forward to what other things and ways I can go about for solving a Physics problem.",0,['0']
"I am here to get a better understanding of Physics 111. I heard that this class would help me get a better grasp of things and introduce me to new ways of studying and working in groups to solve problems.

Being able to solve problems together and be able to understand the material that we are learning together helps me feel better about how I am doing. Even though we all are in different classes learning somewhat different materials, it still all interconnect with each other. Im in this class because I know I struggle with math a little bit and it doesnt help that we only have an hour class when Im used to learning things in a longer period of time. I am here so that I can get a better grade on my tests and quizzes. And if Im stuck on any homework questions I can ask my colleagues or assistants in the class for some clarification. Im basically just here to get a better grade in the class, hopefully I can pass the class. This is my first time learning physics or working with these concepts so I need the most help I can get.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? Why am I attending San Francisco State University? The answer to that is obvious which is to obtain a higher education so that I can pursue a career in the field of medicine. The field of medicine is not my dream job, however, having been able to work in the field as a medical assisting I did enjoy working in the healthcare field. I also know that obtaining a high paying career and actually doing something you enjoy a great path to success. Why am I in this supplementary instruction class? Well, in order for me to achieve the above mentioned goal, I must first get through these science and mathematics classes. I know for a fact that I am not very skillful at doing mathematics or anything quantitative. I could probably take on Physics without take a supplementary class, but taking physics along with chemistry, calculus, and biology during the same semester is rather risky. I would rather ensure I succeed in all my courses this semester so that I can graduate and get out fast. I have failed major courses in the past and I got discouraged and dropped out. Three years later, I came back to this school to finish what I have started and I am not stopping and definitely do not plan to repeat any of my major required courses.",0,['0']
"I am taking the physics SCI class because I do not understand physics for the most part. Right now, I am really stuck on vectors and calculating vectors.

I am really hoping SCI 111 can help me understand my homework so I can do well in the class. The homework seriously causes me so much stress and its only the fourth week of the semester. I need physics for my major and I have never really been good at it. All of unit one and unit two are where I am struggling. Unfortunately, I joined the SCI class as we were beginning to go over unit three, so I am hoping there will be someone I can ask for assistance with the other units. I have tried making a couple study groups, but it has not been able to help me yet. Most people end up bailing so Im hoping Sci 111 will provide the assistance I need.",0,['0']
I am here to soak up as much one on one interaction as possible in the department of physics. Though I enjoy the material and find it interesting its simply not coming to me easily in the slightest. Conceptual physics was a bit of a breeze but this semesters class is turning out to be anything but that. Also I found out that be it that I already have conceptual physics under my belt I dont actually require this class which is a dash aggravating because its so difficult and Im past the point of no return. Hopefully through diligence and utilizing these additional forms of help I have at my disposal Ill be successful in this current physics predicament Ive found myself in. In the greater picture Im here to obtain a degree in kinesiology alongside getting my teaching degree. There is a recent program that state offers where both can be obtained in a streamlined fashion called the itep program. Wasnt aware of it until this semester but its now shaping what my time here at state is going to look like along with what my future might consist of proceeding school. So that is what I am doing here.,0,['0']
"I am in SCI 111 because I have never taken a physics coarse in my life. In high school I took chemistry,which I completely regret. I took this SCI coarse because I have no prior knowledge of physics. In chemistry, I at least have some knowledge from high school and previous chemistry courses here at SFSU. Moreover, it was very daunting taking a science coarse without having any kind of background. Beyond not knowing what physics is or not having any prior experienceknowledge about physics, I wanted to take this coarse in order to get to know more people. Over the summer, I took a bio coarse. The class was small and everyone got along with each other. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had in a college coarse. I don't expect it to be exactly the same, but I do think that it will be very similar. The class is small but that allows to get close, know each other, and help those that need it. Also, the way Hollie and Julie pitched the class was very interesting. It's an easy class and a great way to boost my GPA. Adding on, since I don't have a class that can allow me to unwind, this was the closest I could get.",0,['0']
"I am taking this class because I want to expand my knowledge of physics. I have never taken a physics class before, so I thought it would be helpful to take a SCI class, which would boost my knowledge and give me extra skills to pass my physics class. I never even took a physics class in high school, so I am working with bare minimum knowledge of the subject. I think physics is an interesting subject based on the science programs I have watched like NOVA, and I think it would be helpful to take a class to better understand the programs. I also needed to take a physics class for my major and I am taking the SCI class to boost my grade. Physics is a fascinating subject that really encompasses everything in the world. The common trope is life is based on biology which is based on chemistry, which is based on physics, which is based on math. You need all four of those things to understand how life works on earth and I have taken classes on all those subjects, except for physics, so I felt I was missing parts of my understanding of the world.",0,['0']
I am here because I want to try to do better in my Physics 111 class. I took physics in high school and I can definitely say that it was my least favorite subject so I wanted to take this class in case I am having trouble. I took SCI 115 last semester for my Chem 115 and it helped me a lot when it came to making sure that I knew the material that we were learning in the class. I decided to take this class because I knew that I was definitely going to struggle and I really do not want to fail my physics class. I have always been a hardworking student but I do struggle even though I am a STEM major. I am currently a PreChemistry major but I am trying to change my major to Biochemistry and the physics 111 class is a requirement for Biochemistry so I really cannot fail the class that way I can make sure that I am able to change my major. I overall want to take this class to make sure that I do well in physics 111 the way that it helped me do well in my chem 115 class.,0,['0']
"I am here because I need to take physics for the MCAT and for part of my major. I don't mind being here because I am very interested to see where physics will take me. I think it is important because if you think about it everything involves physics, even medical. Since I want to be in the medical field it is important to learn about all the science behind it or what is the point. Plus while taking physics it isn't bad I actually enjoy the class I learned so much and understood most of it. I am here to learn physics to guide me to where I need to be to get me to point a and b, I am so grateful to be able to part of this class and learn so much and the many different properties of how the world works around us.

"The reason I am in this SCI course is to support and solidify my knowledge in physics so that I can have a full understanding of the material going into a test. Having practice problems and discussions with fellow classmates about class material helps me to review class material that I may miss or not understand fully. I typically struggle with science courses, especially physical science courses with alot of conceptual material so the benefit of asking questions that I have for physics in a small group environment gives me more confidence in general. Another reason that I am in the SCI course is to get a class unit so that I may be eligible for competition in my sport. It is really beneficial that this course functions as a tutoring session and provides units as credit for spending time in the class. As an athlete, having time to study can be hard to manage sometimes so going to SCI once a week acts as a review for a week. I find it super helpful that SFSU provides resources for students to have extra practice and aid to solidify knowledge of certain classes . These resources give students many options to excel in their school work.",0,['0']
"I am in this SCI class because physics is a new subject for me. I am a STEM major, but I have never taken physics before. I was really nervous coming into physics because I didnt know anything. I was scared that I would not understand anything, but Im doing better than I thought. I decided to go into the SCI class because I was talking to my friend about it. We were both worried that physics would be harder than we expected and we both encouraged each other to take the SCI class for our respective physics class as a way to help ourselves. Its my first SCI class so Im still trying to see how this is structured and how I can make it work for me, because the SCI is designed to help me, but as Im doing physics, Im realizing that theres lots of different ways of seeing and understanding the concepts. Through this class, I hope I can figure out how Im understanding the concept through other peoples perspectives and help. I also never made a study group within my classes. This is the first time Im within a study group that are not my friends, so Im still getting used to how to communicate and help my classmates out, because were here trying to understand physics.

"Why am I here? I am in this class because I believe the extra help will be good for me. Going into this semester I thought I would do really well in Physics and struggle in Calculus. When this semester began, I quickly realized that it was quite the opposite. I found that I was really good at Calculus and I was struggling to understand Physics. I also realized that taking Physics and Calculus at the same time was a terrible idea since they teach about the same topics, but the way you work the problems and the answers are completely different. After a couple weeks into the semester, I thought I would give a SCI class a try. I thought it couldn't hurt anything and it would just be an extra study session that I would get college credit for. I am also here because I plan on majoring in BIO with a concentration in Zoology. For BIO majors, we need to take Physics 111 and then if we want to, we can build off of it and proceed to the next level of Physics. Since I will need to perhaps take another class of Physics after this semester, I wanted to fully understand the material as opposed to just completing the material so I can just complete the class.

I understood early on that it is better to go to school when youre younger so that if you decide to have a family, you can be with them more often than not. My parents went back to school when I was little so they took turns working or in school as well as took turns taking care of me. They told me a lot about how it was such a struggle to not be able to spend as much time with me when I was little and that it was hard to be in school as an adult and it is better to get it done earlier than they did.

"Why am I here? I am in this physics class for two main reason. The first one is that it is required by my major, Zoology, to go through physics one and two. Part of me wishes this wasnt the case because my major is all about the study of animals and apart from the physics of their molecules in the bodies of the animals and apart from that physics has no correlation. But at the same time, I am very interested in physics as a whole. I love the fact that physics breaks down the every day forces that we take for granted every day. I am excited to study what makes the physical world work and cant wait for this class to shed some insight into how the physical world around me. Physics for a while seemed daunting and kind of boring too, but now that I am in the class I am excited to test and challenge myself with what this class has in store.

I am taking this class because it is part of my major requirement. I also want to learn more about physics on how the subject relates to the world around us. The subject is useful to many car makers and pretty much everything in our lives. I took physics in high school and I learned a lot then and I just want to keep learning and get a better inside of the subject itself. It is been a while since I took physics and I only remember so much about the subject. To be completely honest if I had a choice I would have probably not been taking the class only because of physics in one of those subjects that I would not mind not taking. Physics is very useful and that is probably the only thing that makes it interesting to learn it. Since taking the physics in high school I have viewed the world a little differently because everything around me relates to it. I have noticed since taking a statistics class that it has a lot of it included in the subject and a little of calculus. I wished that I was more interested in the math and maybe I would not dislike the subject overall because when I saw that physics was one of the classes I had to take I was not jumping of happiness but instead I crunch and put it off for the longest time.,0,['0']
"So far, I see this class as people who have a similar goal to get the job done, and in a hardworking atmosphere, it makes it a lot easier.

Now for the question of why Im here, if you want a clear and concise answer, its most likely due to the fact that its a part of the GE requirement for the school and if i dont complete it, then I wont be able to graduate with a bachelors degree in Biology. Another reason would be that I can see how my lab partners work on the assignment, and that in turn motivates me to work harder than them to get it done as fast as I can while still following the requirements of the experiment. The class is much easier than I expected it to be, however its only the first month of the class, so its bound to get harder sometime soon. However, I believe that I have the idea of how the class operates, so Im sure Ill be fine and pass the class. I will succeed the class and get through all of the challenges that it throws at me.",0,['0']
"When asked the question of why I am here I think about my parents and their experience and message to me. My mom and my dad stopped going to school for a period of time before they had me and once they did have me, they took turns going back to college while working in between. During this time, they were not able to spend time with me and would have my grandparents take care of me. They were stressed out with work, school, and me. When I started high school my parents talked to me about the struggle with balancing our family along with school and work. My mom and dad cemented in me that the only way to avoid such a hectic beginning to life was to go to college right after high school, since that is what they wished they would have done. I see why they want me to go to school and I want to make them proud. I found my calling in the sciences and am now pursuing a career in child psychiatry am here because I want to not only better my own life, but better the lives of others to the best of my ability.",0,['0']
"I am in physics 112 because I need it for my major, environmental science. I was not looking forward to this class because I thought it would be quite difficult and I would struggle a lot. I am already four weeks into the class and it is not as bad as I thought it would be. I enjoying being in class when I actually understand the material, however, when I do not understand a topic, the class becomes quite frustrating. I try my best to go to my professors office hours and study material I did not understand in lecture, but sometimes I still do not understand. If I did not need this class for my major, I would not have taken it. I am glad I am taking this course because I think it will help me with my future career in environmental science. Environmental science encompasses a variety of science including physics, chemistry, biology, ecology and geography; so physics plays a vital role in my major. I attend every class so I can get the most out of my education and learn the vital facts about physics. I enjoy the lecture more than the lab because I understand it more. If the labs were a little clearer, I feel like I would enjoy coming to class more too.",0,['0']
"Im am currently a student at San Francisco State University, and I am in one of many physcis classes offered in SFSU. Alike many I am here to expand my knowledge about specific topics. I am not the smartest student in the university, and often, I find many topics difficult and are harder to to learn than others, but I am here to take on these challenges, and expand the limitations that are in my mindset. The standard I set for myself is very low, but i hope to change that. With the tools that obtain with these classes, I hope to take these skills into a practical setting. For example, applying to it to bigger questions like how to the world works the way it does. This can then give me an opportunity to take the next step and find my purpose and be successful in life.",0,['0']
"I am here because this is a prerequisite class for my major in Computer Engineering. This course fulfills my physics class requirements and teaches me how to apply methods of using computerinterfaced measurement hardware to programs. At the same time, I need to practice so that I can be prepared for the next class level Physics II as well as my future engineering classes. Not to mention, it can also fulfill my general education class requirements for college, then I can move on to upper division classes. Furthermore, this physics lab course will allow me to learn how to use a variety of instruments. In addition, I will be able to learn the techniques to measure physical quantities and determine their relationships. Not only that, Physics I can help me in the long run by providing the many resources to teach me how to use sensors to record and calculate physics experiments. In addition, it will be helpful for remembering and understanding concepts of physics, as well as improving how I record data and hypothesize experiments. With this in mind, I hope I am able to apply what I will learn in this class to my future classes and career.",0,['0']
The reason I am taking Phys 112 is because I need it for my Phys 111 class. I need Phys 111 because I am a Biochemistry major so I need all the science courses that I need to take to get my degree. I have never taken Physics before so I feel that I am learning the concepts slower than my other classmates. I want to get a Biochemistry degree because I want to be a pharmacist as a career. I hope it works out.,0,['0']
"I have attended the physics lab class this semester. There are some factor why I enrolled this class. Beside getting the credit and meeting the GE requirement, I have the interest in it.To be more detail, Last semester, I have finished the general physics class and with a decent performance but what I learned just are some theoretical knowledge. Now I want to have a try to touch with practice so in my mind there exists a motivation of taking part in the physics lab class. Of course, because of my proficiency of theoretical knowledge, I think this class is relatively easy for me and I can do it well. This is a challenging class that test my cooperation and communication ability. During this class, I work with my partner. We make and analyze some datas together, which is a joy in the class, and can build up my oral communication ability. Its the most important that, I think my practice ability also have a increase to a degree. I never feel repentant to enrolling the lab class. These just are the reasons why Im in here. I think its vital to feel a class interesting. In the future, I hope that I can still do well and get a great grade.",0,['0']
"This course is one of the prerequisite courses that I need to complete before taking any upper division science courses. Even though this course might be a requirement for me, I still think that the materials that we will be learning throughout this semester will be essential to my learning and understanding of our current world. I took one year of physics during my junior year of high school. I didnt do well in that class because Ive never spent time trying to understand the concepts that were being taught and rarely asked the teacher for help. Now that Ive decided to persuade and obtain a college degree as a biology major, I want to expand my knowledge of our world by learning and understanding the physics that we live by everyday. I remembered that physics labs are always fun and educational, so I will be looking forward to all the experiments well be performing this semester. I am here because I really want to learn about the basic concepts of physics. I want to mastered these concepts so that one day I could explain to my friends if they ever ask me about anything that has to do with physics. My goal for this course is to stay on top of my game and pass all the exams with a B or above.",0,['0']
"I am a first generation college student and I am here to prepare myself for my future in teaching special education. I came here from Texas in order to experience life in a different place and try something new. My reason for San Francisco State University is that it was originally started as a teachers college and although it isnt one anymore, it still has a wonderful teaching program. I am taking Physics as a freshman because coming from out of state, college is quite expensive, so I want to get my GE classes out of the way as quickly as possible so I can eventually graduate as quickly as possible. Because I am a freshman, I didnt realize that I needed to be in a lab along with my physics class, so it was a bit of a struggle to get into it. Luckily I got added to this lab just before the last day that I was allowed to get into a lab to stay in class. I was excited coming into this semester to take physics because I am a very logical thinker and I feel physics really falls in line with that line of thinking. In my junior year of high school I had been excited to take physics, but we had a teacher that didnt teach and just asked us to cheat on the tests so that he didnt look like a bad teacher, so Im excited to get a real education on physics.",0,['0']

I became more interested when I took anatomy and decided that I would like to become a physical therapist for children and working for a childrens hospital someday. Or I am also interested in sports medicine and orthopedics. I have been working retail for 5 years now and I know that type of career is not for me that is why I am trying to better my education and pursue something that I enjoy and I am interested in.

"I am at San Francisco State University to further my education in a field I enjoy. My major is Biochemistry. I chose this major because both biology and chemistry fascinate me, and my career goal is to become a pathologist, a scientist who studies the causes and effects of diseases. I never really knew what I wanted to study until my sophomore year of high school when I took biotechnology. That class managed to change the way I thought about science. Being lectured and then left on our own to do labs was something I looked forward to every week. After taking biotechnology, I took chemistry and then biology and I knew that this was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Growing up, I was interested in music. I played the violin for six years and joined my schools choir for four years, but I realized I wasnt passionate about it. I would think about what I really wanted to do when I got older and I couldnt imagine myself still studying music after high school. I did a lot of research on different science careers that interested me, and I have finally come to the decision of doing pathology. This way, I will be able to work in a lab, knowing that I am helping the health of people all over the world.",0,['0']
"I am enrolled in Physics Lab 112 to fulfill the academic curriculum expected by my major, kinesiology. I never had the opportunity to take physics in high school or community college; my presence in this class is my first exposure to physics overall and I will admit it is absolutely terrifying. I do not have a strong background in mathematics and I know that physics incorporates many concepts found in math. I am also terrible at understanding the conceptual components that physics presents. It is hard for me to imagine what some of these concepts look like and I am hoping that my attendance in lab will help me to understand some of the material that I am learning in physics lecture. I will say that after having done a few of the physics labs already, some of the lecture material is beginning to make sense. I get a sort of epiphany. I wish I could understand the material better, and quicker for that matter, but honestly I will take what I can get at this point. I am hoping that this lab will give me a steady foundation for learning physics. I do not want this class to just be a prerequisite to other courses in my major; I would genuinely like to have an understanding of what is taking place and how I can apply that knowledge to other areas in my major.",0,['0']
"I am in physics because I need to take the class. I need to take this particular physics class because I am a biology major and also because I was nervous about taking AP Physics in high school and decided not to do it. Which is interesting since I did all the history AP classes that my school had available as well as AP Chemistry and AP Biology. I had a pretty strong aversion to taking a physics class. So far, I think my nervousness was unwarranted because I feel pretty comfortable with the material that Ive learned in class so far. I think that physics is necessary to get a really wellrounded understanding of the sciences. We have to understand chemistry, physics, and biology for all the science majors and it makes sense because they lay the groundwork for all of life and are all tied together. Its harder for me to completely process all the information in physics, only because the processes and concepts are less familiar to me than the concepts in chemistry and biology. At the same time, physics makes sense because I can physically see everything that we discuss like gravity and acceleration whereas in chemistry, I just have to trust that electrons actually exist and interact in the way that Im told they do. Physics complicates more general life interactions so that I can look at what happens more complexly. Its almost simultaneously more difficult and less difficult than the other broad sciences. I think that Im able to understand all of the sciences pretty well, mostly I think because I have a passion for them and make a greater effort to comprehend them. I am here in physics 111112 at San Francisco State University because I am pursuing higher education and a science based degree.",0,['0']
"For this physics lab, I am taking this course to fulfill part of my lower general education requirements for my major, Kinesiology, and for more units. Also, I am taking this physics lab as a requirement for the physics lecture. In a general context, I have learned some physics in high school, but not as thorough and engaging as I would have enjoyed. I am hoping to learn some new concepts and apply them in this physics lab course. Some of the concepts that I am very eager to learn are electricity of the energy portion and sound waves. Electrical currents have always intrigued me on its reliability and complex simplicity. Similar to electrical currents, sound waves travel by a pattern or frequency that is also very intriguing for me. Overall, I am here to learn more about how the concepts of physics coincide and work with one another. For my major, I am mainly applying it to the movement and physiology of the body, how it move and perform exercises correctly and without hurting ones self. Especially with weights and machines, physics will be useful for measuring a persons limit and how far to push their bodies while exercising.",0,['0']
"Im in this class because it's a step to achieving a bachelor's degree in Kinesiology. It helps in understanding the mechanics of the body which is an important part of the career I'm trying to go for which is physical therapy. The class I am taking concurrently with Physics is anatomical Kinesiology and in that class we also went over Newtons first, second and third law to understand forces acting upon the body. For me it's a step towards a bigger goal in my life which is to graduate and get into a DPT program. That's also the reason why I took this class specifically because it will help me get into a DPT school, it's one of the required prerequisites before applying. I feel that what I learn in this class will help me in the future because PT is all about analyzing the bodys movements and if there's anything that we can improve on and Newtons laws and knowledge of forces will help. Overall I just want to learn everything that I can that will make it easier for me in the future.",0,['0']
"My name is STUDENT NAME and this is my second year at San Francisco State University. My major is biochemistry and I have taken many prerequisites to complete my major. The reason I am taking general physics is because it is part of a prerequisites for my biochemistry major. Another reason why I am here taking physics is because I have always been interested in the topic. In high school, many of my friends were taking physics and AP physics and I would hear about the topics while they were studying. Listening to what they were study seemed interesting and to learn about the law of physics was in intriguing. Last semester I decided to take physics to complete another prerequisite and I signed up for the lecture. I did not realize that the physics also had a lab class that goes along with it until I saw the road map from the biochemistry department. I then signed up for physics lab on Mondays because I wanted to take the lecture and lab at the same time. I then learned in the beginning of this semester that in order to take the lecture, you have to be in the lab at the same time. I was able to stay for the semester and take the physics lecture and lab. And that is why I am here.",0,['0']
"The most reason why that I am taking this course is because of major obviously and also beside that I really enjoy the physics course and mostly the lab. Because what we doing in lab shows us that physics is happening in every minutes of our live and in every situation even when you are doing nothing something related to physics it happening. Also another reason that I am here in this course is my major used to be math and physic when I was in my country and I did really good at them but as I moved here I change my major to biology to become optometric.After I done with my career my job should be related to math, physics,and biology. Optometric has so many physics calculation to determine patient eye number so what I need is to improve my skill from physics base to achieve my goal.",0,['0']

I enjoy school and its not typically something I am forced to just do. I wanted to study science and physics was part of my requirements so that specifically why I am in this class. Surrounding my major, I decided to go to SF State and stay home because it would help me save money and allow for me to think bigger for med school and be able to go away.

The concepts that are taught in physics are harder for me to comprehend than the other science courses. Besides this class, I am here in SF State to learn and gain enough knowledge for me to apply into a nursing program after I graduate. I choose to be in college as I will choose whether or not I can excel to succeed in all my courses. College is a privilege and a choice and I choose to educate myself so that I can get a big career in the future. In terms of my presence, I believe that God has a time and place for myself here in this school, earth, and where I am in life.

By doing it that way, I may be able to better understand the lecture or lab course because they relate to each and discuss similar concepts. Some people I know recommend taking them separately to pace myself. However, I think taking them at the same time will allow the material of the course to stay fresh in my mind so I can apply it later.

"I am here for many different reasons. Im at San Francisco State University because I chose to go to college at a place close enough to home for me to be able to commute and still get to explore a new area. I knew I wanted to go to college since I was in kindergartenwhen I realized that my dream career was to become a veterinarian. The implications of the amount of work and dedication that vet school required didnt fully hit me until I was in high school. I am a first generation college student, thus the whole college application process and requirements were new to me. I decided to take AP classes in high school to better prepare myself for the heavy work load that I would be dealing with after I graduated. My parents immigrated to U.S. in large part to provide their future kids with better opportunities and the financial stability required for us to go to college. However, the decision to go to college was completely up to us. I knew I wanted to become a veterinarian thus beginning my upper level education is a huge achievement to me and Im happy it makes my parents proud as well.

I can honestly say this is one of the hardest classes Ive taken so far, since I had trouble understanding since day one lecture. I am here taking this class because I am genuinely interested in being a scientist, though. I know it takes time and patience to get to where I want to be, but I know I can achieve once I get my head straight and focus enough. In the future, Im hoping to be in the medical field, specially working in sonography. My aunt is someone I look up to since she is a radiologist at the Stanford Medical Center in Palo Alto. I want to be able to follow in her steps and to make my family and her proud.

I do enjoy learning more about science in general. Science can be applied to so many aspects of our lives, especially physics. I hope that through this class my understanding of the subject really grows. I find the subject challenging, so I definitely have a lot of room to grow in it.

After all, there is a reason why human connection is incredibly important to our health. I believe we are all here for a reason, and whether it may be right or wrong I believe it is noble. My belief is that we are all here for each other, whether it may be to love or to hate, we all learn from one another.

Having to take this class expands our horizons to how the world works today. In medical school, I will need to understand the human body and how each part works and why it works. In physics, we will learn about how pressure and forces work on our body and this will be fundamental to how I will diagnose and understand my patient's conditions or symptoms. I also have talked to one of the advisors for PreMedicine students and he provided a thorough list of courses I needed to take ignorer to satisfy the prerequisites for medical school.

God put everyone on this earth to live freely, but with a purpose. I believe that purpose is to see which people were caring and nice, and which people are mean and a threat to society. In other words it seems life is just the test, and whatever is after life is the bigger picture.

I am here to prove that I can do anything I set my mind to, not only to others, but to myself as well. I wouldnt be here if it wasnt for my parents constant support financially, physically, and mentally. I am grateful for everything they have done and will do to get me where I need to be.",0,['0']
"I am here in this physics class because it is a prerequisite for my major. I need it to be successful in this class to be able to go on with my major. Also I want to be an optometrist and this class is part of that journey. To understand the concept of physics will help to be more knowledgeable in my surroundings. I think it is important to learn this to be able to explain whats going on around us. I like how the things we learn in physics to be applied in real life. It also helps us to use it into our daily life. Like understand velocity, acceleration and displacement to determine the motion of an object. Without learning this we are unable to build mechanical things like cars, buildings, planes, all the devices that help us improve our daily lives. To be able to quantify and predict the position, velocity and acceleration of an object is very helpful to prevent collision and accidents.",0,['0']
"The reason why I am in this class is because it is required for my major. I have never taken physics before, just because when I hear the word physics it personally fills me with dread. Im not sure why it has that connotation built into my head, but its there. I probably wouldnt be taking it if I didnt have to, but I definitely do. Biology has always been my favorite, mainly because its about life, and that interests me more. I personally dont like learning about the more mechanical processes like gravity and stuff. Im basically here to further my education and to definitely learn something new, that I havent learned before. I think its often very important to take a class that is out of your comfort zone because that is when you learn the most. To be a wellrounded student, you should be able to know at least the basics of some different subjects, and then you can focus on learning a lot about the one, or two, subjects youve chosen to study.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? If the question is for the purpose of getting me to question my existence, then it worked. I don't know why I'm here, in this Universe, but I know that every event in my life thus far has let me to this moment of questioning my existence. I think assuming there is a purpose behind my existence implies I was ""created"" and imbued with that purpose from the beginning. But I don't think that's the case at all. Whatever the purpose may be, if any, I know why I'm at San Francisco State University, taking Physics 112. I guess I can say that I've found my own purpose, as cheesy as that sounds. I want to make something for myself, aspire to do something worthy that will bring happiness to my life, those around me, and those who will come after me. Learning something new, as I will in this course, is a step in the right direction.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? is such a complex question to answer. Why am I here at SFSU? That question does back to the 90s, my parents came to this country to give their future children a better life than the one they had in Mexico. Fastforeword 18 years, three kids later, and one on their way to college. I took the JC route; college tuition was too expensive, and it was just economically better for me to go to a junior college. I always knew what I wanted to study and go to college. I had to take advantage of the chance of getting an education. I wanted to make my parents proud and wanted to obtain a college degree. When deciding on what school to transfer too I remembered how much I love the atmosphere of SFSU and of the city. I am currently studying Biology here at SFSU and am so far enjoying it.",0,['0']
"I have spent a good amount thinking hard about this question and I still can not manage to answer it properly. When I think about Why am I here, many questions arise like why am I in this class? Why did I chose to take a career path that requires this course? I am currently a junior at San Francisco State and I am taking this course to fulfill my prerequisites to apply for medical school. As an environmental studies major, taking a physics course is not in my core classes nor is it an elective for my major. Im not a huge fan of physics largely because it been a subject that has been extremely difficult for me. This is my first time taking physics in college and it been a rough start but I am hoping I can understand and learn from it.",0,['0']
"I enrolled into the physics 112 lab course at SFSU, to complete a major requirement for general biology, however it is also required that I take physics 111 and thus is essential for me to take 112. Building off that, in essence, I am in this course to complete the graduation requirements for my major. Physics has always been a subject I have had trouble with. Going into this course I feel uncertain about how well I will do, since the last time I took this class was in high school. Even though this isnt a course I took for myself, I only registered to satisfy school requirements, Im putting all my effort to learn more about physics and how to apply this information to the world and to my major. I may be thinking now that I will not use this information outside of this class however, if I eventually learn this to not be true I will be grateful for having taken this course and being prepared for my career even more.",0,['0']
"I am taking this physics lab because it is a mandatory requirement for my major. However, since I am required to take this class I might as well try to understand and learn how we could use physics in the real world. I think physics is a really difficult subject in general, and being in the lab and using handson learning abilities helps us understand what is actually going on, rather than just giving students a problem and doing the math for it. We actually get to see how things really work and see why they might work the way they do. Something we would not be able to do if we were just looking at a piece of paper. It also allows us to experiment and understand our own trial and error. Doing things by hand can cause a lot of human error, but since we know the math we are capable of fixing our errors and redoing the experiment. I hope to take in as much information I can from this class, and bring it into the real world when I finally leave.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? I am taking classes at San Francisco State University because my parents both decided to immigrate from their home countries, and happened to meet and fall in love in this city. Eventually, I came along. We never left the bay, and I had lived my entire childhood in the cities San Francisco and Daly City. Growing up, I always had an interest in literature, and then music. During grade school, I taught myself how to play several instruments. It was truly a passion of mine. With my best interest in mind, my mom continuously attempted to curb my interest in music. She saw it as a massive waste of my time and future were I to pursue it further. Instead, she pushed me to join the robotics team. Although I am interested in science now, her pushing me to do robotics did not affect that choice. I eventually had to find my own personal reasons for wanting to pursue STEM, and part of reaching that point took me thinking about my own future for myself. After graduating from Oceana High School, I decided to work parttime and go to school parttime at City College of San Francisco. I tried my best to take the most general of general education classes while I was still deciding my major. I still couldnt help but take a music related class every semester, whether it be an electronic music class, chord theory, or live performance bands. After a couple years of doing this, my general interest in topics began to differentiate. It took working at a research and development style private sector startup to realize I particularly enjoy studying virology. This company had a program of regularly taking in interns, and I was lucky to be one of those people. I eventually decided to quit this job to fulltime pursue my undergraduate degree in microbiology.",0,['0']
"I am taking Physics along with the lab for a few reasons; I am interested in the subject of Physics, it is a challenging course that looks good on my transcript, and it is part of my curricular for the school I am transferring to. For the past 2 years I have been trying to get accepted in California Maritime Academy. I needed 60 units to apply there as an upper division transfer. They only have a few courses that transfer over that SF state has. This is one of them. Im using my time wisely and getting rid of the classes that I can take here that transfer over. Even though I am upper division and already have half my units finished, I still have to be at the school for 4 years because of the specific criteria it takes to graduate. I am interested in Physics because I am a surfer and lover of the ocean. There is a lot physics involved with waves and how they form. It is very interesting to me and to be more knowledgeable on the matter makes me a better surfer.",0,['0']
"I am here at San Francisco State to get by Bachelors degree in General Biology. When I chose this major out of interest I didnt look into how challenging it is. I want to be a veterinarian since I was little and it seems to be the only thing I want to do. It is also good for me because I have always been good in the science and mathematics field. Its still a challenge and I am not extremely good, but I know that if I try my best I can still achieve decent grades. So far in my college career I have managed to get okay grades but still succeed when I am not doing so well in a class. I love biology and chemistry isnt my favorite but its easier for me to understand than any other major not in the STEM field. Last semester I took physics 111 and I didnt think it would be as hard as it was. The last time I took physics was my freshman year of high school so I couldve used a refresher. Although I failed most of the test I began to go in for help and spend more time, maybe sometimes six hours a day trying to understand the concepts. I didnt have time for the lab, therefore, I am took it this semester. It would have probably helped me get a better grade in the lecture class to take them together, but it wasnt as bad as I thought to just take the lab which also serves as a refresher for my next semester taking physics 121 and physics 122.",0,['0']

I dont need a car to get around the city because of the bus, and Bart, and, there are so many fun areas. I feel happy being able to explore and have fun. I am also in San Francisco State because I really felt like it was the right school for me. The school is a good size, and has a lot of amazing buildings. Everything is convenient. I was able to live close to school, and if I am ever hungry or need supplies, I love how there are stores nearby. I feel like I am able to succeed as a Biology major in this school.

I am nervous about how I'll perform in this class because I tend to struggle with my science courses. I want to do really well because I have managed to do well in science even though I do not get the grades that I would prefer.

I am here in this physics lab because it's a requirement for my major. I am nervous about taking a physics courses because I have never taken one before. In high school i opted out of physics and took courses like physiology and forensics science. I have always been afraid of the math portion of physics because math isnt my strong suit. Since entering my fourth year of college I have greatly expanded my math boundaries but I am still nervous. Physics 1 and Physics 2 are requirements to get into UCSFs physical therapy program so Im not going to let my fear of math stand in the way of my goals. I hope this physics lab and the physics lecture will help to boost my self confidence. I am excited to enter into a new field of study that I have never actually learned before. Making real world connections between what I learn in the class room and all the types of physics around me everyday will be very interesting.,0,['0']

This class is also extremely helpful because it helps me review what I learned in lecture and use what I learned in class to solve for how to do the labs within this class. Lab classes as well help give insight into what we were learning and focusing. It goes further into the theories and definitions and I believe it is important for me to learn those from this class.

I am here because I want to learn more about all types of science and one day go into my field of study and being happy and successful. Honestly I'm also here because I want to give physics another chance, especially in a college setting as it's very different from learning it in high school. It also helps to further understanding about how the world works around us and connects with both chemistry and biology.

I am also here to enhance my learning for this subject as well. I know I have taken AP Physics in the past in high school, but have struggled along the way and barely passed. I am hoping that this course will be different, and will go more in depth to know how certain things work.

I used to hate physics at high school because the teacher was not passionate about teaching. So the class was boring and I did not get the chance to fully enjoy the fundamental understanding of physics until I attended SFSU. I hope that by taking this lab class will help me have a better understanding of motion and the way how things works.

I am a little bit worried about my performance in this course but I can't really get around it. So, I suppose I'm here because I have to take this course in order to graduate. My apprehension towards physics isn't because I find it to be particularly boring or anything negative like that, I simply just find it to be intimidating due to my past experiences. But I'm hopeful that this semester I will find a way to appreciate physics because I love learning and I can't really picture my life as being anything other than a student.",0,['0']

In the end, I decided to make Sf State my home because I wanted to get away from home yet still be in the vicinity. I guess my purpose is just to get my degree in biology and work at a lab. I chose biology as my major because I love working on humans and learning more about human life. I also love science because I enjoy seeing how things work out out.

My goal is to become a veterinarian and I knew that I didnt just want to just do the minimum of work. I wanted to challenge myself and I wanted to perform at my absolute best. I decided to change my major to Zoology and I'm working towards a minor in chemistry. I'm often asked by my friends why I have to calculus and physics courses. When will I ever be using these subjects as a zoology major? All of it is intertwined. It is a universal language. And they are essential to one's academic success.

"For a question with only four words, it is deep (for me). I am here because it is a requirement for my major, which is PreBiology and most importantly for medical school. I have never taken Physics in my life until now. I did not have a chance to take in high school since it was full. Taking Physics now in college terrifies me knowing that I do not have any knowledge from it at all. I hope calculus will support my learning in this course in any shape or form. Even though it terrifies me, I am still willing to learn Physics. I know that this different field of science will give another perspective of how I will see the world, the universe, and how everything works from force to gravity to energy and beyond. Lastly, I am going to learn Physics with purpose. I don't want to be here because it is a ""requirement"" but I want to be here because I want to learn from it.

"Well, I think the obviously answer and probably the one that comes up the most is that this class is required for my major. In fact, I was very much NOT excited to have to take a physics class, even though obviously it makes sense to have a fundamental understanding of the subject in any other scientific field. Still, I had a very annoying experience in high school with physics. Overall, I did fine in the class, I guess, especially since it was an AP class. But it was the course I most remember as being frustrating and hard to understand. I vividly recall the only time I have ever BSed on an academic test which involved the displacement of a snake. (Instead of answering, I just drew a picture of a sleepy snake that never left his nest (i.e. displacement of zero). Turns out the answer was zero but not because the snake was sleepy.) Plus, we had to make a lot of little 'machines"" like a mousetrap car and, for some reason, I WAS NEVER ANY GOOD AT THAT. Again, frustratingly so.

The answer is in no way short or linear, to any of these questions even the most straightforward on, but I don't think many things are? At least not that I've seen.Part of the answer has some basis in how I came to be on this Earth, I think. I owe it in large part to my mom. I'm here because of her in the most simplistic, biological sense but also in every other sense; spiritual, emotional and so much more. I exist thanks to her, and in a lot of ways I believe that the purpose, more than how I came to be, is driven by her own existence. I owe everything to her, my life, every opportunity that I've had would not exist because of her and I think I will spend my entire life trying to show her that everything she's done has been worth it and meaningful. My number one fear and inspiration (could they be the same thing) is not making her (and my dad) proud.I've also grown to see her, and my other immediate family simply ""exist"" to continue existing, and my Dad has always instilled a ""follow your dreams""optimism.

"I am here to take this physics class so I can graduate with a degree from San Francisco State University. I am studying physiology in hopes of going to medical school to become an oncologist. Ive seen what good and bad doctors have done to people suffering from cancer and I would like to become someone that works in this field and treats their patients with care. My first step to getting there is obtaining my undergraduate degree, which requires for me to past this Physics 122 course. Im currently in my fourth year which wont be my last since I will need another year to pass my majors required classes. I believe I will succeed in making my goal of becoming a doctor because I havent had anything stop me in the past. My parents were immigrants and teen parents so growing up I was at a disadvantage when it came to schools. Living in a low income area of Oakland made certain things to comeby. It was hard but my parents always prioritized school first for my sister and me. Through them I was able to learn from school but from myself that I can succeed. I feel like I will pass this lab with ease since I was able to pass the previous lab without a problem!",1,['Ive seen what good and bad doctors have done to people suffering from cancer and I would like to become someone that works in this field and treats their patients with care.

"Student Name PHYS122 Journal Reflection 1 Why am I here? This is an interesting question. Very broad. In general, I would say that I am here because my parents both decided to emigrate to San Francisco; my father came from Lima, Peru; my mother came from Manila, Philippines. There is a certain pressure put upon many first generation children to thrive for the sake of the family. Ive been thinking about that a lot these past couple years. I wonder how this pressure has affected my development, and in what ways (if any) do I plan to fulfill these generational wishes. Looking back, I would say this pressure to succeed for the family is a big part of why I studied STEM in college instead of the regular hobbies I had growing up: literature and music. It seemed like the responsible decision to make. The alternatives to being a scientist were to be a nurse, doctor, or a bit of a disappointment. Granted, this sounds like a concerning motivation for education, but I must now tell you that I still felt a sense of agency in this decision. It was my decision to study microbiology specifically. I purposely chose not to be a nurse. After a couple internships in laboratories I found out just how much I love doing research. I find it therapeutic to deliberately and thoroughly research a single topic in the lab. My long, long term goal is to make a rapid diagnostic test and sell it at cost to a community in need, as a way to give back to the place where my lineages originally came from.",0,['0']
"A physics lab helps a student in learning the importance of the theory. It brings certainty in the mind of the students about the basic concept of the subject. Students know the difference between theory and purpose. The physics laboratory helps a student in inventing their strategy towards the subject. Experiments carried out in Physics laboratories helps students in learning how to be patient and attentive while using observation and before calculating the result. As a person going into medical school, its very important to learn and adapt to various kinds of labs. Medical schools want to see that not only have you taken labs required for your major but labs outside of school is very important as well. Diversity is very important because, with different backgrounds, a person can gain experience in something that they havent done before or perceived something in a new way. This will help people come up and generate new ideas when working on a certain task. Its very important that I take physics lab so I can expand and gain new experiences for myself and for medical school.",0,['0']
"As a Kinesiology major, the main reason I am taking this class is that it is a prerequisite for Physical Therapy school. I know that this class is necessary for me to become a competitive student when time comes for me to apply to graduate school. While I am not the best when it come to the realm of physics, I know this class will help me gain better insight on scientific applications and improve my skill set in mathematical computation and analysis. I also know that Physics 2 is a very different breadth of study than Physics 1, so I am also interested in expanding my knowledge in physics in general. I would like to see how the concepts I learn here can apply to everyday situations. I hope that after taking this class I would be more confident in tackling physics problems and applying it further in my field especially since I am interested in Biomechanics.",0,['0']
"Im here because I want to pursue a career in the medical field. My major is biology with a concentration in physiology and this major is a pathway towards my career goal. More specifically, this class will get me one step closer to my career goal because this class is one of the required classes for my major. I loved my physics one very much however I disliked the lab part of the course so I am hoping that this lab course is better. I really like doing experiments and engaging with other individuals, Im hoping that this class will consist of much of that. I am in this class to learn about topics that I have never put much thought into before. The last lab was pretty interesting and I enjoyed it because I got to communicate with my partners to try to figure out the work in front of us and that is what I hope will continue to happen in this class, this Is why I am here.",0,['0']
"I am here because I want to be. In terms of taking a physics lab, it is because it counts towards my major which is biology in concentration with physiology. This is my second semester of physics and do I like it? Not so much, because I did not have the best teacher my first semester and it was quite challenging for me. However, I am here because I have goals and I want to pursue a career in the medical field hopefully leading my way to becoming a neonatal doctor. I have a passion for babies and I myself when I was born, was born in a car, so I was incubated for about a month because I did not have much oxygen, so it was a scary moment for both my parents.

"Why are you here? I am here in this lab class because this physics course is a requirement for my major biology. I have taken the prerequisite course to this, and I am currently enrolled in the lecture portion of the class. And this particular lab section was the only one that fin in my schedule. I am taking this class because it is one of the last lower division requirements that I have to meet for my biology major to continue on to more in depth upper division courses .I am also in this class because I decided not to take physics with calculus, even though it probably would have made it easier for me if I did because I already had taken calculus a few semesters ago and got an A in it, so now I had to take general physics two without calculus because I had taken general physics one without calculus.",0,['0']
"I am here because of my parents, my parents fled their country in hopes to start a family where they can provide a better future for my brother and I. Growing up in Vietnam was a struggle for them, dropping out of high school so that they could start working instead to help provide for their families. My parents both didnt want their kids to live through the same struggles that theyve went through so they packed their bags and started a new life in America, even if it meant for them to start with nothing up. This is why Im here at San Francisco State University majoring in Biology concentration in Physiology to in hopes one day become a pediatric nurse and to work as hard as I can so that one day I could return something back to my parents and make them proud for what theyve given up for me to live a better life.",0,['0']
"I am here for a list of reasons. Reasons that pertain only to me and other reasons that pertain to my family or other loved ones. I am here for myself and for everyone that has supported me throughout my journey at San Francisco State. Firstly, I am here to challenge myself and make myself known in the STEM field. The field where women are appreciated less and less accounted for when compared to their male counterparts. I am here to prove to myself that I can do anything that I set my mind to do. To prove to myself that I am capable of more than is expected of me as a Latina, woman of color. I am here to make my familys sacrifices worth it. To show them that it is possible for us, the minority, to become leaders, role models and influencers. I am here to gain knowledge about the world, its people and most importantly, its science. I am here to make friendships and connections. To appreciate all the unique backgrounds, cultures and experiences.

"I am in this physics lab because I need it for my major. But, on a broader scale, I am here dedicating my time and resources to this class because it was ultimately my choice. I made a choice to go to college because I see how difficult my parents and grandparents work without a college education. Also, over the summer I volunteered in Thailand and one thing that I did there was teach in the schools. Being there really pushed me and helped me realize how fortunate I am with the education opportunities that I have. Those kids that I taught (ranged from the ages three through twelve) would hike three hours in the jungle every single week to stay in the dorms to get an education. These students in Thailand have taught me to be thankful for the opportunity I have to be able to go to college.",0,['0']
"Why I am here is because I want to fulfill my families dreams and my own dreams of becoming a successful obgyn one day.

And by that I mean learn things I never had someone tell me. One day when I am not on this earth anymore, I want people to remember me for something I did in my life that inspired them. I have always wanted to help people out. I was born in Afghanistan in a house during the warzone in 1996. You may ask why I was born in a house? Because back then the country was so strict that most husbands would not allow a man see their wives, even if it was during birth.

"I am here in this class to fulfill the requirements of UCSFs Physical Therapy School. I understand that they want to make sure that I have a certain level of academic competence by getting an excellent grade in second semester Physics. After all, their program is intense, and they want to make sure that I am able to keep up with their curriculum. I am confident in my academic abilities as I boast a 3.89 GPA with 135 units under my belt while doing extracurricular activities like being a president of a school club and working 30 hours a week. Being able to do well in a challenging class like Physics II will further validate that I am able to excel in a challenging curriculum and will further convince UCSF that I am a good fit for their program. It also shows academicmental flexibility as Physics is not related to the profession I am pursuing. By doing well in Physics II, I am also able to show UCSF that I can excel in material that I am not passionate about and this is telling them that I can do well even if the topics that they might teach me is not particularly exciting in my opinion.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? Thats a difficult question to answer. If by here, you mean to ask why I am alive at this place and time, then I dont know. I dont believe I have any higher purpose and that Im only here because of chance and the odds being in my favor. If by here, however, you mean to ask why Im in this class, its because I have to be. Im a biology major and its a requirement, but I can at least admit I enjoy doing physics labs. Sometimes I enjoy them more than Biology labs because theyre more chill and you dont have to follow a strict dress code. I chose this major because I enjoy science and as much as I wish I was good at it, I suck at math. I still think physics is awesome because its a lot easier for me to comprehend and explain problems with real life situations.",0,['0']
"Im here because I need this class is a prerequisite for my major. I did not enjoy phys 111 it was hard for me. I heard this class is different compared to phys 1. I am excited about that, but I bet its still as hard. I enjoy learning about physics, dont get me wrong, but it takes me a while to get the hang of things. Now if the question is referring to why am I attending sfsu in San Francisco, Ca. I would say that I am here because this city really captured me ever since I came to visit, Ive always thought it was amazing city. I feel really blessed to be here because its a city where I have developed myself as an adult. Although expensive, its definitely worth it in my opinion, at least to go to college to. Im attending SFSU because I am trying to get a major in physiology. Biologyscience has always been my passion. Its hard but its the one subject that doesnt hurt to study for. I think the reason Ive always liked science is because theres never a moment where it doesnt fascinate me. My mind is always blown when Im learning new topics regarding the subject. Whether its anatomical or regarding the earth everything has an explanation, even the smallest thing and that never fails to surprise me.",0,['0']
"I am here in this class because it is a requirement for me to move on to my other major courses. I have little to no interest in this class.

If that is the case then I need this class to better prepare me for the physics portion of the MCAT. I am a biology major so this is the last physics course I would need for the remainder of my undergrad. I waited quite some time to take physics in my undergrad because Ive had bad experiences in the past and the many times I enrolled in physics the professors I was stuck with were some of the worst professors Ive ever taken here at SF state.

I believe that the best way to achieve this goal is to through an education. I think it will increase the magnitude of the impact on others lives. I have hopes of getting into a career in healthcare. Secondary, I am here to learn. It was not always as apparent to me what the purpose of education was in high school, I felt like learning in high school was a little mechanical, and about moving through the motions. It was not until college that I learned the applicability of a good education. It applies to just about everything in my daily life, especially subjects like math and science. University has taught me the applicability of these subjects subtly.",0,['0']
"I am taking physics 121 because it is a requirement for going into graduate school for physical therapy. For my physics is very difficult to first comprehend which discourages me a lot. I took general physics 1 and I was confused on how it related to my goals. However, the more invested I became in my future career the more I noticed that physics plays a significant part especially when I took biomechanics. Now with the understanding of where physics falls on my plan to physical therapy, my views have improved. This motivates me to try my hardest to learn this material so it can help me later. Physics 2 is difficult but instead of giving up like before, my attitude includes ambition and determination.

I have a strong interest in focusing on mammals or marine biology when it comes to an even more specific focus. I love being able to spend time with amazing animals that most people do not think about on a daily basis. I want to be able to educate people on the environment around them and how their actions can affect thousands of other living creatures.

By being in this class I am also able to apply what I learn in lecture to real life models and cases. It is important to be able to relate the way in which these different theories are a part of the real word and our life.

It is important for me to pass this class, so that I can pursue my degree in helping me towards finding a wellpaid and decent job Im most passionate about one day. Not only for these reasons. I would like to learn other topics in relation to Physics. It may be helpful as future reference when there might be a situation or problem I may encounter in my life since some of the analysis and theories are relatable to use. Physics contains different topics that we have already covered in class and I know some are difficult to understand, I want to be able to feel confident especially when it is time for studying to do the homework and exams. I want to make sure I can understand the material well enough for me to pass this class by the end of this fall semester. It would be such a big help and difference for me when I do pass because I would then realize all of the hard work I have set was worth it. I know there will be some topics I wont understand or have struggles on, but I want to utilize the provided resources on campus such as tutoring and attending office hours to visit the professor in discussion about my class grade standing. I hope this semester will not only challenge me but also encourage me to not give up on struggling situations and be able to preserve until the end.",0,['0']
"I am here because honestly, I have to take this class as a prerequisite for my major, which is General Biology. As a matter of fact, while I am required to take this class, I understand why it is important to be a requirement for any type of science major. This course teaches you about Physics and how everything in the world works and normally as a human being with two eyes, what I learn from physics is something that one cannot see with the naked eye and I find that fascinating because you are learning the formulas but also you are learning the secrets of the world in the form of numbers to be able to comprehend it with the human mind. You are able to find a common knowledge that is attainable because physicist in the past have studied this phenomenon for centuries and this course teaches a curriculum of that subject matter. This class is also important to be able to have the opportunity to get hands on with the material taught in the physics 121 lecture portion of the course. I am looking forward to learn more of this subject and to be able to apply that in my future endeavors.

Therefore, this class will help me in depth of why everything happens the way it does. I no longer hate math or physics and i have learned to cope with them.

"Why am I here? I have an obvious interest in studying how the universe operates, and very little of that has to do with life sciences from what has been demonstrated to me so far. It would seem that life is the exception, and that the physical laws are somehow connected to how life operates. Gravity, thermodynamics, mass, acceleration, velocity, light, magnetic and electric forces are involved in every facet of reality. Therefore, studying these subjects is required if youre trying to study the properties of the reality that we all share. Life only seems to be a property of these subjects combined, which is the end result rather than the process. Of course one could say this is a post hoc observation, but I would argue that these are evidences for how life occurred since it would appear that they're a mandatory part of the life existing. On an academic note, I have to take this class in order to finish my degree path and Im uncertain whether or not I would if it wasnt required.

In a different and more general sense of why I am here, well, I know that I am here because I have given this gift of life and I try my best to make the best of it everyday. I know that sounds cliche, but it is true. There are so many bad days that I encounter, but when a good day comes along, it seems almost worth it. I actually dont exactly know why I am here.

"Why Am I Here? The reason I am here is because I need this class in order to fulfill my lower division unit requirement for my major, Zoology. Furthermore, my interest in physics is lacking due to my major. I understand that everything that can be done has a reason, like gravity for example and why things fall. But if I am being honest, I am okay with just knowing that it exists. I do not need to and do not want to understand exactly why things do the things they do. I know it is important, but again, I will not need it for what I want to do later in life, which is being an animal physical rehabilitator. Maybe knowing wavelengths and rays of light might help with cold laser therapy and maybe knowing how buoyancy works when it comes to water therapy. However, I feel like as long as I can do it correctly. I do not think it will matter what the calculations are.

Being in the lab gives me opportunities to learn more about various topics I have learned during the semester and have a better understanding of what I have learned in the past. It also gives me the chance to have the handson experience and apply and improve my knowledge and connect the dots between what I learned from lectures and what I learned from labs. We all know that physics apply to the real world. Maybe by being here in this lab, I would learn to be able to apply physics to reallife situations. The application to real life may help me understand how certain things turn out to be. For example, I can have a better idea of why it is easier to hold the middle part of an object than one side of it.",0,['0']
"Id say Im here to get an education and try to work my way towards being a doctor which is something I aspire to be. In a more literal sense, Im in class to make sure I do well in classes and pass the course. My parents have supported me a lot so they also factor into why I am here. Im thankful for the opportunity to attend university away from home and get my degree. And I wouldnt be here without the support of friends and family so in answering the question, Why am I here. I have to credit them with some consideration in my answer as well. All in all, Id say Im here for a variety of reasons for a variety of answers. I'm here to do my best and be the best version of myself and live my life on a path I would like. This is why Im here.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? Im here because Im trying to major in the STEM field, specifically I want to enroll in a PhD program after graduating with a B.S in Cell and Molecular Biology. However, recently Ive been enjoying some of my prereq classes for my major such as physics and chemistry. Even though I never had the chance to take physics classes before, Im here to dip my toes in other STEM fields. I suppose Im taking this physics course so that I can expand my general physics knowledge to see if I can apply physics concepts in my future research work. By enrolling in Physics lab, Im learning to apply lecture concepts onto real world applications. This is helpful since it will reinforce my confidence in physics concepts, and that confidence will help me feel more at ease in research environments (specifically research labs for PhD programs). Despite being a biology major, I genuinely believe that understanding basic physics concepts will be applicable in my future research work.",0,['0']
"Why Im Here I am here because of my career goal. I want to be a Doctor and have a subspecialty as a neonatologist. They take care of premature and critically ill babies. This lab relates to my end goal because I want to have mastery of all topics in science. In being in this lab it serves as the first step of many. I also find physics super interesting like it is confusing for me, but once I understand it I see why people choose to pursue a career in it. I also want to add that being in this lab allows me to hone my physics comprehension which is a plus.",0,['0']
"The reason why I am here is because my major requires me to take this physics to continue my education. This is my last physics lab I need to take, so I am trying to end on a good note. Also, it is nice to learn more about physics, but the main reason whyI am here is because my major requires me to take this class. It is nice to learn more about modern physics, and how I can apply it in the real world when I need too. This class will help me further my understanding, and more importantly have me continue on my major pathway. This class will help me one step closer to graduating, and that is why I am here. By graduating I can pursue my goal of going to medical school, but by that I need to pass all my courses such as this lab course.",0,['0']
"I am here for multiple reasons. I am here to fulfill my graduation requirements. I am here to learn the basics required to become a Physician. While fulfilling these requirements, I am here to learn and understand the material that are given to me and hope that they will be used after I receive my degree. I also hope to remember them in the future. While Im here, I hope to meet new people who I can learn from or share knowledges and experiences with.",0,['0']
"I am here in physics to learn how physics applies to my major of physiology. I am here to learn how different physics concepts will help prepare me for my future major classes and also help me in my profession one day. I do not love physics, but I am willing to see how these concepts will better prepare me for the future. That is why I will try my best to understand the concepts I am being taught. Being in physics and excelling in this class will prepare me for human anatomy and human physiology which apply directly to my major. This class is prerequisites for those classes and I hope that physics helps me excel in those classes.",0,['0']
"""Why am I here?"" This essay is meant to connect you to your purpose. This is not meant to be a formal essay. It should be streamofconciousness writing from the heart. You will be graded on participation only, not on the specifics of what you say. 5 minutes of reflective journaling should result in an essay of about 150200 words. After you finish your essays, we will provide some class time to discuss your thoughts, to the extent that you feel comfortable sharing. I entered the Physics 121122 class with the intention to expand my knowledge about physics with the hope that it will be different material than Physics 111112. I have struggled with understanding physics since high school, yet I enter every class with the mindset that maybe today it will click. Despite the fact that I need this class for my major (Biology), I am at college because I hope to learn both inside and outside of the classroom as well as ideally apply what I learn in school to the real world. Based on my understanding of how I learn so far, I think that I am more of a listen, write it down, and speak it type of learner. After being in physics 121122 and chemistry 115 for a few weeks, I think that visualizing what I am learning is very important. I hope to use this skill for my current classes and see how this impacts my ability to learn and understand. Often times I struggle with taking tests so I am hopeful that this semester will take a positive turn from visualizing my work.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? Throughout my entire life, I have dreamt about working in the medical field. I am here to make those dreams come true. It started as one of those careers that elementary school kids talk about when their teacher asks them what they want to be in the future, and my answer was always a brain surgeon, because how awesome does that sound. But this dream ended up sticking with me for the duration of my educational career and is the reason that I am attending San Francisco State today. I find the field to be very interesting and I can see myself enjoying it for the rest of my life. However, I need to make it through a long and difficult path of schooling to pursue this dream. Throughout my educational career, I have been pretty successful in passing all of my courses. General education has been a breeze. Biology and chemistry courses have been great because they come naturally to me. Math always seems to give me a little bit of trouble, but I get a hang of it after pushing myself to do the best I can. But then there's physics, which seems to always give me a little trouble. I am here at SFSU to grow my knowledge in all of these subjects, which will help me succeed in the future. Looking forward to a great and productive semester!",0,['0']
"Why I am here I am currently taking this course because my major requires me to. Personally, I think physics as a course is wonderful in high school because the topics were interesting. However, the lecture course I am currently in makes it difficult to grasp the concepts. Whether it is the professors here at SFSU or subject itself, the entire subject is difficult to learn and understand. I wouldnt take this course if it werent on the pathway to Biochemistry. Ive taken Physics 2A equivalent to physics 111 in city college and the professor explained most of the concepts clearly. I passed the class and enrolled into physics 121 and 122 to complete my pathway to continue on to earn my Biochemistry degree in the future. So far, I really enjoy this lab course because my lab professor does a great job in communicating with his students when there are any sorts of confusion in the lesson. Overall, I am here to complete my degree in SFSU.",0,['0']
"After moving to San Francisco from Southern California, specifically Carson, I know that I am here for my education only. It is currently my third year here at San Francisco State taking 17 units in order to graduate on time in four years. I am majoring in preKinesiology and taking classes that I need to get into graduate school, hopefully the Physical Therapy Program at California State University of Long Beach. I just finished my undergraduate courses and now taking that classes that the program is looking for. This semester I am taking Physiology and lab, Bio 230 and lab, Physics and lab, Yoga, and Political Science. I am taking these classes to fulfill my requirements needed to get into the graduate program in order to become a Physical Therapist. Therefore, I am here for my education.",0,['0']
"I am here taking this class because I am a Biology major and need to take this course to graduate. I have never been that interested in physics in all honesty. I have never been good at it either. However, taking it in college has allowed me to understand it better than I did in high school. Physics to me has a lot of complicated parts and a lot of formulas. I think my biggest problem are word problems. I am not bad at math but I always seem to struggle with word problems specifically and physics is all word problems. If I dedicated my self to study more and actually learn physics properly, I know that I would understand it well and be able to apply it to real life scenarios. This is the last physics course I will be taking in college and I want to make sure that I finish off strong and feel accomplished because I know physics is an interesting subject and I would love to know and understand more about it.",0,['0']
I am here because I need to take this class in order to move on further into my major of computer science. Taking this class allows me to see the equations that we see in class to solve problems put into real world uses and allows me to further understand the equations and reasons that these equations exist. Taking this class gives a hands on experience with problems that can be solved through math and science. These problems can be seen as practice for problem solving which allows someone who is in computer science like me to be able to think of a way to code something and solve it more efficiently through the problems we experience and experiment with in the lab. Labs are also a good way to take all the equations that weve learned and to put them to use on a lab project which allows us to see how each equation relates to one another and the importance of each equation in their uses.,0,['0']
"I am here in this physics course as a requirement for my degree here at San Francisco State. I came here to pursue my goals of becoming a doctor of some sort. I came to achieve my bachelors degree in Biology, in hopes of going to medical school right after. I chose to go to college to not only fulfill my dreams but my parents dream as well. Coming from the Middle East and Asia, my parents did not have access to the best education systems. My dad however managed to leave the Middle East at a young age to become a pilot. He made his dreams come true, but it did not really last long. All he did was fly for a couple years and moved to the US with me and my mom. All they did was sacrifice everything to have better opportunities for their children. I could not let that sacrifice be for nothing.",0,['0']
"I am here in this class to get my degree, but I am here at this school to better my life. I am here to allow myself the opportunity to succeed in something bigger than myself. Being here has many different meanings and perspectives. On a day to day basis I will say I am here to just get through the day or that I am here because I feel I have to be. I am here in this class because I had to enroll in it but also to actually learn the material. I am here in this city because of all the schools this most likely had the best tuition rate and most appealing place to live. Overall I am here for my future.",0,['0']
"The question can be subjective. I am here because I am required to take this class for my major. I can see how it may relate to my major. I can also see how calculus has to do with physics so therefore, I can correlate the two subjects together. I have to take another physics classafter I finish this one.Also, why am I at this particular school? I am not from San Francisco so I thought it would be interesting to attend a schoolout of the city that I live in. I also like the handson experience or experiments involved in physics. I can also correlate that with the calculus thatI've been taking. Hopefully taking all these integrated math classes for my major, I can be very wellrounded in math, although it takes me a While to compute problems, at least the answers will be right.",0,['0']
"I am here because I am a BioPhysio major, and this is a requirement for medical school. I have never taken a physics class before but truthfully I thought by taking this class in place of the other physics series I would able to get another requirement out of the way without spending as much money. However, I am unsure if I want to continue down the path of preparing for medical school and may decide to do something else with my major. Maybe through taking this class I will develop a stronger interest in physics and want to discover different interesting aspects about it. If I decide to change my major, which may not be the smartest idea because I am currently a third year and that will set me back a lot for graduating on time, I would change it to some sort of engineering major because of my father being in the engineering field, sparking my interest toward it. I hope through this class I am able to meet more people to study for the quizzes in this lab as well as those in lecture and create a large study group.",0,['0']
"Currently I am in the Physics 222 class to develop a greater understanding of Physics. However, looking at the broad spectrum, I am here to continue to build my knowledge of science and its impact on the world, and to use that to further my education and aid me in going to medical school. I strive to one day become a neurosurgeon, and I believe that my education right now gives me practice and knowledge that will aid me in becoming a neurosurgeon, and just simply giving myself ideas of how Physics works. I believe life is a step by step journey, that can be broken down into many little parts. I am in the journey of college, and more specifically in the journey of Physics. I hope that in this class, I will improve on my quantitative thinking, and will improve on formulating the work I have done in experiments. These two things, I believe would the most influential aspects of this class on my future, and would help me conduct better thinking in my future classes in both college and medical school. For one, being able to use numbers to solve problems, or for example determine how large of a dose a patient may need in a hospital is an incredibly beneficial skill. Second, writing out lab reports, helps me learn a way to focus and organize my work in a way that can be used and aid anyone. If I was writing a patients state on their charts. It would be best that I know how to write it in an organized way that makes it easy to understand the patients status.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? For most of us here it is to graduate with a degree from a higher learning institution so that we may gain a job and finally make money to support ourselves. I do not want to lie and say that this is not also my goal. I have always had a passion for hands on work and an affinity for math and physics. All of this has lead me to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering, ultimately leading me to taking this course. Higher education for me is a Segway into the job field, without it would make getting a job in the future that much more difficult. This is the main reason I am here today. In todays society most individuals want to support themselves and their family as well as live as comfortably as they can. For me I want to as well which has lead me to be here as well as pursue education past high school education.",0,['0']
I am here to learn physics in a laboratory setting for my major. This class is mandatory for my major and is also a prerequisite for other classes that I have to take for my major.

I am looking forward to learning many things about how things work and interact. why are there objects that pull each other while others repeal? What happens when a ball falls down? gravity, air resistance? there are probably more factors that go into it that I don't know yet. Not only will I learn new things but my analytical skills will be sharpened and the way I approach a problem in finding a solution.",0,['0']
"As an aspiring computer science major, Physics is one of the classes that we need in order to even get into the field. I find Physics to be quite difficult, however I'm taking it in order to have an understanding for it so that I am able to apply it into my computer science work in the future. Although I had taken Physics during high school, I never really excelled in it because I found it too difficult to understand fully. This is why I am taking it again in college. I find it pretty hard to pay attention intently during class, so I didn't take AP Physics, which led me to taking it now. It was hard for me to remember things such as key terms and concepts, and so I'm taking it now because I assume that the pacing is a lot better, and the teaching will be a lot smoother than before.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? Good question. Sometimes I ask myself the same thing. With school life it really hasn't been fare to me. At 28 years old, I have came across several roadblocks that has directed me to quick. But yet, I am still persevering to become the Mechanical Engineer I am setting out to be. Sometimes I feel that I am too old to be in school especially this semester. I see more 18 year olds and it just makes me feel that much older. Plus the fact that I am trying to graduate before the age of 30 while most of these kids will probably graduate at 2122 sometimes gets the best of me. But to be honest in the back of my mind I know what it has taken me to get to this point. At the end of the day I just know to keep my eyes ok the prize and the rest will come along. Even with this kidney stone I still do my best to come to class through the pain. So why am I here?

"I am here because I think its important to show up to classes no matter how tired or bored you are. Going to class can be more clear than just reading from a book because you have explanations to help you. Going to a lab is good too because you can see how all the concepts play out. That especially helps me learn because handson learning is the best type of learning in my opinion. I will always try my hardest in this class because I feel that this is where I can learn the best. I am also here because I want to graduate on time and not fail any of my classes. If I show up to my classes there is a greater likelihood where I pass my classes if I show up. Also, if I do skip class it will just snowball and cause me to skip more classes.",0,['0']
"I am here to fulfill my prerequisite for my major but also to get a better understanding of physics. Everything we do would be considered physics, something falling, how fast we drive and how far can be calculated in physics and measuring. It is crazy to think that everyday life and actions can be calculated with physics or have to do with physics. And it is pretty fascinating to be able to learn more and fully understand why this happens. Especially since I will be using physics in my everyday life it would be pretty important to me to learn it early and fully understand it rather than struggling in the future and trying to understand it while Im at a job wouldnt really look too well on me. Im very excited and eager to learn physics.",0,['0']

I am here because of something greater putting me here to accomplish something that I may not even know about yet. Most of the time I do not think about why I am here, but the question runs through everyones mind at least once in their life and they contemplate what exactly life is and how we got here.

"Why am I here?My journey into physics started with my interest in computers. After working in IT for a few years it was inevitable that I return to school and finish my degree if I wanted to proceed further into the field. Physics happens to be a branch of education of my CS degree so that's a majority of the reason I'm taking the class. With that said I've always been a fan of math and science, the idea of why things happen in the real world have crossed my mind but I've never really understood enough to explain what I see. A lot of the people I've talked to dreaded taking physics but so far I've really enjoyed my time in the class. I like gaining the new perspective on what I see and hope to be able to use this knowledge going forward to test or even extend what I know. I came into this knowing the class would be challenging and I'm grateful for that as it continues to keep my attention. I'm prepared for what's ahead and look forward to expanding my understanding of what I already know. My hope for the class as a whole is to go forward in life and take advantage of the information; at the very least be able to make a few cool science experiments for my children when that day eventually comes.

"Well the first reason I am here is because this class is a requirement for my major. Honestly though I think physics is really cool. I've seen a few astronaut movies like The Martian and the one with Matthew guy who's in a bunch of movies. After seeing them it made me really interested in physics or possibly majoring in physics but after starting class last month I realized that physics is actually really hard. Well it might be hard because it's all math and I haven't been doing so well lately. Actually, I'm starting to dedicate more time to my physics homework cause I just failed last week's physics quiz so I am working on not doing that anymore. I hope that is the only low score I get. I did okay on the first quiz, but that was because I prepared earlier. I dont know I didn't feel very prepared for the second one maybe because my professor delayed all the material and we got pushed back. Anyway I think astrophysics majors are so cool and so intelligent. I feel like they just do math all the time which is what I do as well while I'm going about my life. I literally use math for anything like calculating how much time I have to get ready and do my make up, how long it's going to take to get to school, to make food. I think it's incredibly useful especially in video games which is probably why I like games so much. Oh that's another reason why I'm interested in this class. I really want to be a video gamer programmer and I know that physics is really important in that industry because of animation etc. I feel like learning physics is going to further help me in my future endeavors.",0,['0']
"I am here because I am interested in how the universe operates. I enjoy STEM topics such as mathematics and biology, and I am beginning to become more fond of physics. This summer, I have been fascinated by the study of higher dimensional objects such as hypercubes, hyperspheres, etc; how they would appear in our three dimensional world, and how they would appear if I was a forth dimensional being in a four dimensional world. However, I must go back to basics and start off with classical Newtonian physics first. Also, I do have an interest in becoming a video game developer, more of an interest in open world simulation games such as Grand Theft Auto, because behind all of the obscene video game humor is a world that is simulated to act like ours and able for the user to traverse. I find that amazing; in order to work on games where they model real life physics, I must know how real life physics works.",0,['0']

I recently learned in philosophy about why were here and what makes a meaningful life. Being able to cherish others and value others is something that gives me a reason to care about life, and I dont feel that I should just live a life for myself since I feel it wouldnt be much of a meaningful life if Im only fulfilling things that make me satisfied.

In this class, I aim to strengthen my skills and refine my scientific procedure to the max. I am a fan of science and I am upset with all the antiscience bias that the world is seemingly going through right now and the best way to combat that is through education and enlightenment.

"The reason why I am here now is because of my mother. She was able to give me everything I needed to in order to continue on my journey. I went to a private Elementary School and High School due to my mom being a Civil Engineer and being able to provide for my brothers and I. I went to community college after High School because I wanted to help save my mom some money in the long run. During the first 2 years at community college, you take a lot of the same General Education classes that are offered at any 4 year university as well. That was my main reason behind it. I am currently trying to finish my Civil Engineering degree as I live at my mothers house and work a part time job at UCSF. I hope to finish up within the next 23 years as I have to complete 130 units compared to 120 units for any other degree. It has been a long road but I will definitely pay off in the end.",0,['0']

I am here because I believe that by getting my degree I will be able to better my life and my personal growth by starting a career in civil engineering. This class is just another small step towards that goal. In addition, I find physics to be very interesting as it affects us in our every day life. I am better at learning subjects that are around real world problems and where you can work hands on and actually see what you are dealing with. This allows me to learn faster.

I can remember being in the eighth grade looking up different theories of physics, like Einsteins Theory of Relativity and using it to explain black holes. Black holes and space in general also fascinates me tremendously and I want to be able to understand our universe through physics. I have always had a small urge to invent machines for different purposes, like once I wanted to make a snow cone machine that could mix any two flavors into a swirl. In order to be able to invent anything I know I need to understand the physics behind it.",0,['0']
"I am here simply because it is part of the requirements of obtaining my degree. I transferred from SJSU this semester after I switched from being a premed student to a computer science major.

I am a Disabled Veteran and am coming back to school to learn skills more properly suited for civilian interaction, basically here to learn something thats not related to killing and dealing with guns since all those skills do is help me stay in the cycle of protection lines of work (cop, security, etc...). Keeping an open mind I am looking forward to this transition and know it will be difficult but after the military nothing really can be that bad, or can it? Expectations for this class are high I suppose in the fact that this course takes prerequisites to even get into. Im here to learn and will try my utmost best to obtain a B grade Ill take a C but want to aim for a B. The reason A is not mentioned is because I realize the challenge in front of me and with current course load I will be multifocusing so all my time and effort will not be in this class alone.

"Why I am here? That's a great question. I am here for multiple of reasons. The first major reason on why I am in this class is it is required lower division course for civil engineers, and with this course I can't graduate so.. yeah. The second reason I am here is I actually enjoy doing math, but i am not sure about physics. I enjoy the challenge for solve problems that people have trouble with. I feel as though physics is also a class that relates to real world applications a lot. You see physics in everyday life such as gravity, acceleration, etc. So to wrap it up the main reason on why I am is here is because it is a required class, but also I kind of enjoy Physics and the challenge that comes with solve the problems.",0,['0']

I am here to learn all the things I possibly can. I will probably have to memorize a lot of formulas and make sure I dont slip up on my math. It seems like a daunting task, but I think I can manage. This class seems very comprehensive compared to college prep physics that I took in high school, so I feel that I will be heavily engaged in this class. I really hope this class will be fun and help reiterate the curriculum I have learned in my physics class.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? Theres a lot of reasons as to why I am here, attending college. I have goals that benefit not just myself but also my family as well. My first year here was stressful, for being given heavy loads of homework each day. I guess that the college experience, but I have made it this long, These past three years have been a quite a challenging journey, adjusting my school schedule with work is still a hassle. Every day, I am encouraged by my family and friends to continue on and remind myself of that I am very close to the finishing line. I am here not to become a failure nor end up like many that called inquits after their freshmen year. I know the journey will not be linear, I know that I can overcome these harsh barriers that will try to consume me. I will prove to those as to why I am here and what I plan to do after I leave here.",0,['0']

I am taking physics to not only fulfill a requirement for my degree, but I am also wanting to learn more about how things work and move. I want to be able to understand it at a level that will help me in a future career.

This is important for both my future in terms of improving my quality of life through understanding and my quality of life through having the knowledge to pursue my career. Physics will most likely not come up in my career of computer programming, unless I go into a specific field that pertains to physics or requires it, but again, unlikely. This is a part of my set course of classes I need to take to get a piece of paper that says I learned a bunch of stuff I most likely will never use. But it's not a waste of time because I am learning how to learn, learning to take leadership, learning to create goals and achieve them.",0,['0']
"I am here because I need this class as a lower division requirement for Computer Science. Ive tried to take this class earlier during the last fall semester but unfortunately, I had to drop because the class was getting harder as well as my other classes at the time. Just from my impression of the last fall semester, physics is pretty difficult for me especially when it comes to calculus. Ive barely passed calculus and its also very difficult for me to learn without help from others. I think for the most part I always overcomplicate the problem when its actually fairly simple. I dont necessarily care for physics but it is interesting to learn about and especially being able to understand it but I can also live without knowing too much about it. I think the calculus is what scares me away from the subject.",0,['0']
"im a STEM major or more specifically im a mechanical engineering major. Ive taken a physics course before in my juniour year of High School and received a B, but in all honest I have no idea how I got that grade. My knowledge on the subject of physics other than the basics is kind of abysmal and my knowledge when it comes to electricity and magnetism is pretty bad. Im willing to work hard for this grade and do whatever is necessary to do well. Though i'm not going to lie, ive been a little embarrassed to seek help in the past I know without extra help I most likely will not pass this class. So I'll do my best to come on time and be present for whatever activity youll have instore for the class and I'll bring my willingness to learn, a good attitude, and hopeful enough knowledge and understanding on a topic to help someone else who might need assistance. I'll also try my best to be more willing to participate and raise my hand more to help move the lesson along, but I will say I am kind of shy, so please be patient with me.",0,['0']

"Hello everyone!I'm not only taking this course to fulfill my major requirements but also to understand a little bit of the basic science around us. I believe that knowing a little bit of every subject in college is what makes the graduates ready to face life with a good foundation of experiences. I'm currently taking two classes and a lab for my first semester because I have a fulltime job. The main reason why I chose San Francisco state university is because it's more convenient for me to commute between home, work, and school. plus it has a beautiful campus in the middle of the city where everything is closeby. commuting to San Francisco every day from Sanmteo is a little bit costly, so hopefully I'll be able to find a good apartment closeby, and maybe find good internships that relate to my major to help me get a good start in my career after I graduate.",0,['0']
"The reason why I'm taking physics because it's required for my major degree. My major is mechanical engineer which requires me to have a lot of math classes along with physics. So taking physics this class is a mandatory class I need to take in order to reach my degree of being a mechanical engineer. Since math and physics are related to each other I would need to take all the required pre physics class along with all the other pre math required class in order to move onto the higher level of physics and math classes. Also I know that being any type of engineer is required to understand majority of physics and know how to do calculations in order for myself to become an engineering field specialist. Overall, physics, math, and any other science are a big major and impact on the degree that I'm aiming for along with helping me learn all the materials needed for my future careers and what I want to be when I apply for jobs.",0,['0']
"I took this class because of the requirement for my engineering major, but obviously because of how important this is to the subject matter. I don't have any low expectations for this course, and I hope that the lab supplement can help me understand the lectures even more, despite the onceaweek meet time. I only hope that I will be able to finish the lab, understand what I did, and write a decent report sooner rather than later so that I will be able to leave early than the lab's official end time.I don't really have any extra thoughts to add to this reflective journaling, as I don't believe that I will have any worries about my subjects until I get further into my discipline and go through more higherlevel courses as opposed to this introductory course.Overall, this is my first year here at the college, so I am hoping that I might start to like it more as time goes on.

Regardless of our everyday chores and tasks, we still exist continuously (as far as we know). So the here could very well be an extremely relative term. How are we supposed to know where here is? As far as I can tell we are in the year 2019, but honestly if we were to use a more accurate calendar for civilization the year is actually closer to 12019, if we begin our count at the beginning of the process of domesticating crops which is the start of the world as we know it today. Viewed under this light, the here seems much more significant and also almost unreachable. Weve come so far and the progress weve made as a species so significant, that it is difficult to appreciate what life was before now.",0,['0']

The reason Im here in this class is to help get me closer to getting my bachelors degree in computer science and hopefully work that up to a masters at least. This class is one of the first classes towards the major you have to take(as long as its required to take when taking phys220). The reason Im here at SFSU is because Im from the east bay and always loved the city and knew right away how I wanted to go to school in San Francisco so I could be close to my family and old friends and also because loving both the college and the city that the college is in is amazing. Im currently a second year(sophomore) and this is my first year living on campus so just knowing the location of where I live is amazing too and Im so excited to get the experience.

I took two years of physics in high school and kind of fell in love with the subject. I originally got into San Francisco State as a physics major but decided to change it because I plan on transferring to another school in the Netherlands and they only offer an astronomy major for English speakers. Its a pretty amazing school so I figured these majors are close enough. Since I was planning on being an astrophysics major astronomy is not that far off from that in my opinion, so Im perfectly fine with it. I might eventually change it back and decide on transferring to another school but that is an issue for the future. But either way, this class is a necessity.",0,['0']

Most people say students are supposed to figure out their purpose in high school but Im in college and I still dont know. I guess that I am currently searching for what my purpose is but right now, my head is a mess. I guess I am here because of the average timeline of a person in a first world country.

I am taking a higher physics course than the one required for my course, because I don't want to do it for the grade.I actually want to learn and improvise the knowledge that I already have. Something about physics that actually struck me was its applications, i.e. when I actually tried to relate it more to the events that were actually occurring around us, like circular motion, slipping of vehicles on a wet road, etc. I took physics class, because it is something that I enjoy solving and putting brains into, apart from my major subjects which actually involves a lot of memorization. Physics helps me get out of the memorization zone and get into a more logical zone. I understand it, thats why I like getting involved in it.",0,['0']
"Physics, per se, is fundamental and hence prerequisite, giving high impacts on our life. The answer to why I am here depends on peoples mindset and their preference. One of the greatest scientists, Einstein, says, the most important thing is not to stop questioning. As he mentioned, physics give us a tool to have questions for everything. Humankind creates many inventions such as car, computer, and AI by questioning. It is high time to reconsider how to make questions because AI is developing, and it will replace our jobs with automation. What AI can do is only induction. If we develop another thinking ability, we can survive. Physics has an innovative thinking way, deduction. By learning Physics, we can improve the ability, deduction. For example, Elon musk can make cheap rockets from the deduction. ten years ago, rocket was too expensive to create for a private company so only NASA was making rockets. People believed in the rocket was an expensive thing. However, Elon thought of why the rocket was so expensive. He considered the problem from principles and then he found the solution to make inexpensive rockets. At that time, NASA ordered parts of rocket to company and it accepted the price which company showed. Elon understood it was possible to reduce the cost of making rockets. Finally, he succeeded in launching rockets as the president of a private company. How did he learn how to think? he acquired his thining ability from Physics. When he was in university, he majored in physics and business. Anyway, I want to improve the thinking way, deduction trough learning physics.

If I didn't chose to be here, I would honestly have no idea or guess to where I would be now but all the decision making and experiences i've had in my life has led me here.

I think physics will be hard but I believe that there needs to be a lot of time and dedication to succeed in this Lab and during lecture and I will do my best to succeed. Also I am here because I applied to San Francisco State university and like here but not so much the commute because it I take the ferry and the metro about one hour and forty minutes till i get to school.

I learn more from hands on experiences and generally more willing to learn when it comes to labs and experiences that involve actual physical involvement.

The majority of my family has taken an interest in coding and programming, so I ended up following in their footsteps and decided to major in computer science. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do as I was heading into college but my decision to major in computer science wasn't completely influenced by my family.

Honestly I am really excited for my physics courses this year much more than any of my other classes. Physics never ceases to stun me whenever I think about it.

Physics is one of the required courses to be complete to graduate from the University.

I am here in this class to fulfill my requirements for my bachelor degree in computer science. But i also find math facilitating how you can just understand people by simple integers. So I think that physics with math really get the whole perception of what we are . Explains how things work and pretty much in my eyes how why it works through math. Its pretty interesting to understand the way things work. Im hoping to understand and capture the understanding of everything. But I really want to learn somethings that I can take outside of this class and say woah thats co and want to teach someone else. I just wish the class was longer Bc if you sit in the back you are screwed. Also every time Ive went to get the lab manual it was difficult they are always closed. Apparently my schedule that i have does not meet the hours they are open so its difficult to get materials . It would be nice if the teacher sold the class set the second day of class to ensure everyone has the materials needed. But thats asking a lot homestly but most of us as college students work and its difficult to go around it sometimes. But I love this class so fR and the teacher seems really nice and fun. Very enthusiastic about teaching which I live because some teachers are like this is just my paycheck and do not care.,0,['0']
"Firstly, I am here in the class to meet the requirements to obtain my Bachelors degree from San Francisco State University. My thoughts on why Im here as in my physical existence, is a question I have always had (as Im sure lots of others have asked themselves at one point in their lives), but I never went further than asking myself that question and wondering why. why I'm here then begs the question, who am I? What is my identity? How did I get here?Ithink this class will be very informative as it will help me understand the world better, and that will in turn help me better understand who I am. By applying the scientific reasoning behind how things work, I can use that knowledge in real world situations, like finding proper measurements of an object to find further information on that object, which then can be used for other purposes.",0,['0']
"I am here in an effort to complete the necessary requirements I need to transfer to Santa Clara University as a mechanical engineering major. Regardless if I get accepted or not the overall goal is to become one step closer in finishing the required courses to graduate with a degree, and hopefully get a good job. However, in a short term sense I am here in this lab to further learn about physics in a hands on way and get a good grade that should help boost my GPA, and prepare me for future classes including the next higher level Physics Courses. Lastly, as an engineering major I hope to get valuable information that can provide me with a better understanding of engineering in general in the work life and possibly even in the future if I choose to pursue a Masters degree. Ultimately, I am here in regards to pursuing a better future for myself.",0,['0']
"Parts of why I am here has a lot to do with the Universe and life trials that lead me astray just to bring me back to pursue my education but as a Computer Science major this time. Although Physics is a requirement for my major, I love science and always have as a child growing up. I am more present than before now that I have an internship at UCSF to do medical research, which is amazing because now I can actually apply what I am learning to something meaningful to help others by giving a voice to under represented minorities in and through research. It is really important to have meaningful projects to apply what we are learning because we can help our society in some way. I always think if every class on campus took real life issue and had their classes look for solutions to solve them and actually apply them in our city what beautiful change we could see. I am not just here but I am present, to learn what I can to help the world in my own way through science, through justice, and from the heart.",0,['0']
The reason why I am here is because it is a prerequisite course for my major which is computer science. I also want to learn more about physics because the subject really interest me. I enjoy trying new things and Ive never taken a physics course before. Also It will help me get a better understanding of the law of physics. I like doing labs because I get to collaborate with others and work on lab assignments. Working on lab assignments helps me understand physics better because I have group members that can help me out or Vice versa. This will strengthen my knowledge of physics so I can use it for the lecture portion and it helps me better understand calculus. This will help me meet other people that are in the same major or similar. We can form study groups and prepare for the next advance physics class.,0,['0']
"I am a second year student at SF State, major in Computer Science. I think the reason that I am at this Physics lab are more than one. At first, it is a requirement of GE class and my major requirement. However, I didn't think it is the most important reason. During this physics lab, I got the chance to know more scientific skills. It is a good chance for us become more confident in future class. I think it is a challenging yet interesting class, since we discover the law in different things. Our life include something contain Physics but I didnt realized before. The Phys 220 introduce me the principles and practice with class, and Phys 222 let it become the data we can see and calculate. During the process of discuss, analyze and conclude, I have more sense of how other classmate think, and what I need to improve.",0,['0']
"I am here to further my education, to help myself get a degree and to provide myself with a better opportunity to have a well paying job once I graduate. I am here in this class because it is a requirement for my degree and it it also going to help me during my physics class during the year.",0,['0']
"I am a transfer student and this is my first semeter at SFSU. Of course, I'm here because this is a class on the request list of my degree. However, that is not the only reason because on the other hand, physics is my favorite subject.Therefore, even in my first semester at SFSU, I chose physics. I think you will be most likely to complete this class the best I can and from there I will be motivated for other subjects in the following semesters. When I was in high school, I was a good student of physics and was praised by many teachers. However, at that time, I rarely performed physics experiments. Therefore, I really hope that I can do this at university and I wasn't a bit bitter to register for physics class this term. I am looking forward to experiencing the interesting things in this class in the near future.",0,['0']
"The reason I am here is because I am an engineering major. To be more specific I am studying civil engineering in hopes of working in the structural engineering field in the near future. I hope to pass this lab along with the physics 220 to be one step closer on graduating and working in the career I envision myself doing. With the right push from friends, family and others, I have successfully made it this far into my studies in order to pursue my dream and make something of myself within my community. I am here on behalf of those cheering me on to accomplish the completion of higher education; an opportunity some are not given. I love the creativity and mathematics filled environment where I have a blast playing around with graphs, equations etc. I am here to graduate and become a civil engineer.",0,['0']
The reason I am here is because of my major. I am a computer engineer and I need this class as a requirement but I also hope to get more out of this class than just pass it. I understand that physics is In our everyday lives. I hope that this class will give me a greater understanding of how things work. I also feel that the lab will allow me to get a real life example of what is going on with the world by conducting experiments myself.,0,['0']
"I am here to do some basic experiments on the topics we read in the Physics lecture class. The lecture is very interesting. We read about many basic physics stuffs which can be used in our daily lives. This is PHYS 222 so the labs are not that much complicated as higher level courses. In this lab we will do the experiments related to sound, speed, lengths, forces etc. This lab will help us get to know physics little better as we will not only read about it but will do experiments first hand. Also, I have always been interested in the physics because most of the things in this universe follow the laws of physics. It is very fascinating to see for example, a light feather and a coin fall at the same speed in vacuum which seems very strange. So, I am here to know physics a little better.",0,['0']
I am in this class because it is required for my major of mechanical engineering. Even though I have to take this class I really enjoy learning how it is that the world works. It really fascinates me how you can actually use math to figure out how objects behave and why they behave like that. As an intro course I hope to learn the basics of learning how to calculate motion in objects and be able to do it confidently. Ever since I took physics in high school I became very intrigued by the concepts that exist all around us on earth. I really hope that this course will help me expand my understanding of physics by introducing new techniques like using calculus to solve problems. This being the biggest difference between this course and my high school class. I look forward to having a good and productive learning experience in lab to help me really grasp the concepts taught in lecture.,0,['0']
I am here because I have this feeling I would like to be an architect and draw up residential buildings. When drawing up floorplans and starting construction it is important to understand the physics aspects of the building properties. In order to create a design I will need to understand the correct combination of materials in a formation which will give me enough strength to support the top load. I would prefer not to go to school and learn on the job but despite my preference I have to go to school in order to live a life of drawing layouts and floorplans.,0,['0']
"I am here to further my education and expand my boarders of knowledge. Not only that, but also because this is a required course for my major, but I do enjoy physics. Through this class and every class I expect them to only add to my experience needed for my educational pathway. I believe that there is always something meaningful that is brought into every class. Which means I am gaining knowledge that is not only taught by the professor, but also from my fellow peers. Other than the fact that most people are expected to go to college in their families I think that there could be other reasons as to why people go to college and that is because college is a brainstorming environment.",0,['0']
"I am here because I'm a computer science major. I've always wanted to be a detective and work with computers so i decided to take this path. This class was one of the requirements for my major classes without it i won't be able to reach my goal of a masters. I'm also here because I want to learn and meet new people, build bonds so i can have connections in the future. I'm am here in school because i want to learn and gain knowledge so it would be easier for me. I'm also in this class because I enjoy physics and believe this class will help me with my major. Im here because its important to me to become who i want to become in the future and not be dependent on anyone but myself.",0,['0']
"The reason why I am here is to learn the fundamentals and ethnics of physics and apply what I learned in the future for any possible reason that requires the knowledge of physics. Though taking honors physics in high school I believe that learning physics in an higher level education environment will boost my knowledge about physics as a whole. Physics is one of the most intriguing subjects in my opinion and it is seen everywhere you go throught you're entire life. It is applied in almost every single situation, which is amazing. Any bit of motion from a praising walking to a rocket flying in southeast speeds and accelerations displays that physics can happen anywhere. It would be especially easier to learn about physics now and apply to my future coursesI am also here because it is one of the required courses that I must take in my academic pathway to graduate with my engineering degree here in SFSU.",0,['0']
"The reason why I am in the Physics lab is because the lecture itself cannot be done without a lab, and vice versa. This is also a requirement for my major in order for me to graduate on time. I am a computer science major which involves a lot of math, and Phys 220 is the first science class that is required to be taken and it comes with a lab as well. Not only that I am taking this class to fulfill my requirement, I am also here to learn so I can adapt this skill in case I will use it again in the future. I know in the real world, math is used again time after time after you graduate. If I am not mistaken, all science class have a lab that comes with the lecture which is why I am taking this course, and it will be like this in the future for more science classes I will be taking. Science classes could be really fun sometimes, especially the lab experiments, but mostly, lab experiments can be scary since you might be working with very harmful chemicals. This sums up the the purpose of me being here.",0,['0']
"I believe I am here to better my life. I wanted to make changes to ultimately lead to a better career and a better future for me and my family. I want to be able to say I went back and finished school, but not only finished, but completed a major that most never thought I would be able to do. Computer Science has brought me to this course, while I am generally pretty unfamiliar with how Physics works in our daily lives, I am at least curious to see it calculated and derived throughout actions I do daily.I hope to be able to take away material from this course as I would any other CS course, regardless of my selected major. Although I am not a morning person, I am excited to get started and start chipping away at the lab manual!",0,['0']
"I am here to complete my courses in order to move on in achieving my goal of obtaining my Engineering Degree. Also the course itself is something that I am interested in because I enjoy understanding the way things move and how to calculate them. Also learning Physics is important to me because it is a course that has a lot to do with my planned career. Labs like this I enjoy the most because I have the opportunity to be hands on with the concepts we learn about in lecture. Everywhere we look in the world we are surrounded by physics so it is important to understand. Performing experiments and collecting data is something that I enjoy doing in any subject. Overtime, I have come to enjoy the labs and look forward to them in my courses. I hope to do well in this class and I plan on putting a lot of effort in achieving a good grade.",0,['0']
"This question can mean a lot but the way i see this is as is, ""why am i here in college?"". When i think about it it ultimately comes down to because i want to get a degree in what i am studying, it also comes down to because i want to live the college life and explore n my own and learn from the mistakes i will be making while i am here. I am here studying computer science. Thiis is something that is shitty because i do not want to study CS. it is something my parents want me to study and i and doing so because they are paying for my classes. I want to do business management but sadly i cant. Hopefully in the future i will be able to get into a masters program and be able to do what i want.",0,['0']
I am here at SF State taking Physics 222 because I want to pursue a career in engineering. I want to graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering. I want to make my parents proud and improve their lifestyle. I want to bring more wealth and knowledge into my family household and be a role model for my younger siblings. I am the first person in my family to go to college and I will be the first one to graduate as well. I want to have a career that I enjoy and can provide me with wealth to be able to support my family. I am taking physics because I will need it in order to pursue my major and I want to expand my knowledge in the field of math and sciences. I want to be able to work together with my peers during lab so that I can learn from them and develop my skills as an engineer.,0,['0']
"Not everyone can attend college to make a good life out of them,fortunately I am attending college and am really thankful for this opportunity. I am here in college today because I want to eat a comfortable life for my future self. Now a days there arent many good paying jobs that hire a Person with just a high school diploma unless you get lucky. Going to college and doing well will give me more opportunities, jobs obviously but also more experience in so many ways and last but not the least enough money to start my own family someday. I am learning to become more independent, since I live on campus. I have started to do everything on my own, pay some of my own bills, cooking, etc,. So this is why I am here at SFSU majoring in Civil Engineer. And when I graduate from college I want my background to make a good impression to impress my employer.",0,['0']
"I am here because I need to take this class for my major, mechanical engineering. I'm also taking physics because it directly relates to what I want to learn. Physics has a great deal to do with energy and after I graduate I would like to work with that as an emphasis. This class just happens to be one of the classes I need to take to learn those things, as well as move on to more complicated material in the future. I'm also at school today because I have calculus 3 in the morning that I need to be at so It's convenient to come to this one on Tuesdays. I'm at sfsu on the other hand because it suits me the most considering my financial, social, and academic standing and preferences.",0,['0']
"Ever since I was young I did not really like the idea of school and maybe it was because I was just a lazy kid. However as I got older I began to realize that education is very important. I am currently here at SFSU majoring in mechanical engineering because my parents have been providing for me my whole life and I just want to be able to grow up and find a good paying job so I can finally repay my debt to my parents. Basically the only reason I am still pursuing a higher education is because my parents. I am also pursuing a higher education so I can become smarter because I feel like not going to college is a waste of time since its harder to find a job without a degree. Also another reason why I am here is because I want to meet new people and eventually become good friends with people who were once strangers. In conclusion, I am here because I am doing it for not only my parents but also for me.",0,['0']
"I am here because of social norms, because of the need to, because of family. Education is something valued and normalized in today's society. Before, education was only for the elite, for the people who could afford it. Even now, there are many people who can't afford to attend school and want to while others who can attend school but throw away their chances by not trying hard. I'm never the studious type nor am I the type to believe education holds that much power over someone's life. The question of ""why am I here"" can be answered in so many ways but I think that it doesn't really matter WHY we are here but instead that we are already here.",0,['0']
"Why am I here?I am here because I wanted a significant change in my life. I wanted to move out of the small town that I was living in and discard old habits and beliefs I possessed. I came to San Francisco to change the person that I am. To get a better and broader perspective of life. I have changed so much since I moved here. My friends, which some are from SoCal and others are from here, have made a significant impact in my life. These changes that have impacted my life has got me wanting to share it with the people back at home.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? That's a good question. I often wonder what is my purpose for living. I have to blame my mom. One moment I'm resting peacefully in a warm bath. The next moment I'm being crushed by my mothers uterus. I tried to put up a fight, but I lost. The next thing I know I'm out in the real world. I can barely remember anything about my life. I only have bits of memories from growing up. They feel like small little flashbacks when I try to think back. Here i am now, trying to remember why am I here. I really don't know why I'm here. Im usually lost in my head, and that leads me to feel lost in life. To be honest, I'm here pursuing a degree that I don't even care about anymore. I'm just going through the requirements to get a piece of paper so I wont have my parents breathing down my back. After I graduate I don't know what I really want to do.",0,['0']
"When I read why am I here, the first thing that came mind was that I am here because this lab is required to be taken while I take physic 230. Then I wondered why I was taking physic 230 and remembered it was a prerequisite for my major. Then I wondered why I chose this major over others, and realized because I love machinery. Then I wondered why I love machinery, and realized it was because I loved cars. Then I wondered why I like cars so much and realized that three of my uncles and my grandpa were engineers. It made me remember when I would help my uncle work on his car, or see my grandpa work on fixing things or creating things like his solar cooker. Nows after reflecting my choices to answer the question of why I am here, I guess the answer is because I want to be here.",0,['0']
"To be honest, Im here only because my major requires me to pass this class. Although Im not taking this class voluntarily, I understand the importance of this lab. My major is computer science. We cant deny that the computer has a huge relationship with physics. We have to understand some physics knowledge to know better about computers. I grew up in China, the high school there requires students to learn physics as well. The difference is: Chinese high school emphasize physical theory much more than physical lab. We put so many efforts on solving equations, but only went to lab once or twice per semester. Thus, physics is merely an alternate version of math to us. However, physics is never meant to be like math. Math has its own charm, so does physics. By doing physics lab, we can relate equations to our lab observations. And if the result is matching the equation, I not only would feel happy, but also rewarding. All in all, I am here because physics is a requirement for me, but it doesnt change the fact that this is fun class to take.",0,['0']
"I am here to learn about physics that are related to my major, which would be able to help me after my educations. I personally like physics myself so attending this lab is fun to me.

"""Why am I here"" is quite the openended question, and so for my answer I will choose to answer specifically. I'm here because, according to the Bachelors of Computer Science degree requirements, I need PHYS 232. At this point, I don't 'need' a B.S. in C.S., but A: it would be better to have one than to not and B: this has been something I've been working for for just over 5 consecutive years. To not get a degree now would be a monumental waste of both effort and funds. As to why I'm in this specific section, it is simply because it fits the best with my schedule. I always thought it was funny, because throughout school some of my friends and classmates would choose classes and professors based on either wordofmouth about which professor was easy and which was difficult, or through a service like ratemyprofessor. Having been working my entire college career, I never really got an option about which teacher to takemore times than not, it came down to when I was free, and when my schedule could be shifted to make it work.",0,['0']
"I am here because I chose to be here. I believe that by attending San Francisco State University I have decided to attend here. It was my choice. Why it was my choice is because I dont know. This is a streamofconsciousness, that means I will not be graded on the choice of my words. The speed at which Im typing is probably at around 50 words per minute. Thats not a abritaray number. Iroronically, it is a arbritary number. I believe that physics will enrich my life in so many ways. I believe calculus will enrich my life in so many ways. Walking down the streets of Oakland to catch the bart from fruitvale bart station can be very exciting since I know all this physics things. I can calculate the distance it takes from the house to the bart station. This is reflective journaing on why I am here the great philisopical question.",0,['0']
I am here because I like to know how the world works. Learning about the world in a lecture can be really boring at times even if you are interested in the subject. In lab you are able to work with electricity and magnetism physically and manipulate things to see how they go. With experimentation we are able to get a more solid feel for how things work than just going off of theory. I am also here because as a part of my major I need to take these courses as they are required. I hope that these classes help me understand more of what I need to know in order to graduate. With my degree I plan to get a good career and pay off my loans. Afterwards Ill use my skills and knowledge to find a career that works more for me or that I enjoy more that still can support my financial needs.,0,['0']
I am here because I have goals and ambitions that I want to achieve to make my support system happy. My support system is my parents. Yes they did encourage and force me to choose my major but I do find interest in it. I want to live to my full potential not anyone who has talent and knowledge and not apply it to their life. I want to do that by implementing these qualities to my daily life to become who I want to be. I want to be an Engineering for the future. But currently right now i found another purpose of my years here. I want to be part of a community and make an impact in it. Peoples lives matter to me and i want to make a change. I dont want to be known as that person who is something in particular. I want to be known as that person who is something and did something about it. I want a title but the authority to be that person.,0,['0']

Although I find physics interesting I wouldnt choose to take it on my own if it were not required of me. As a computer science major I understand the importance of understanding physics but do not see myself utilizing all of the formulas and information I learn here in the future. Although I would not choose to take this class on my own, I would not say that I hate the class completely. Being able to work through tough problems with fellow classmates teaches me how to work hard and do it alongside my peers. These are valuable skills that will definitely help me later on in life and going through a rigorous class will only help foster these skills even more.

"I am taking this class not only because it is a requirement for my lecture physics class, but I feel like I can take something out of this class as well. Examples could be the lab experiments we will be undergoing throughout the semester to help further my understanding in my lecture class and my own knowledge. So far in the first lab we underwent electromagnetism and charges. To understand having two of the same charges repel each other while two different charges attract. This is because protons and electrons want to connect with each other, forming bonds. I can remember from last semester when I took your class that I learned how to calculate error analysis and standard deviation. The reason why we learned from before this is because our measurements do have some sort of human factor that relates towards our errors in the experiments we do. In another lab I learned under your teaching was about how to calculate area, volume, and density using the formulas given. Overall I am looking forward to see what the next lab experiments will be like for this level of physics.",0,['0']

"As a kid growing up in the East Bay Area, I always aimed for a prestigious career path because I was unsatisfied with my upbringing. I was the product of a divorced family, my mother was a bartender, my dad wasnt around much, and all of my brothers and sisters were half brothers and half sisters who were at least 8 years older than me. I spent much of my time outside of the house trying to stay busy. I never viewed my situation as traumatic or permanent but merely a starting point for something valuable. I knew that I wouldnt allow myself to end up impoverished, victimized, or addicted. Towards the end of high school I found out that through hard work in my studies, I would be able to reach my goals and even provide the next generation of my family the opportunity to enhance their living standards as well. In the future I hope to be able to provide my children, nieces, and nephews the ability to get an education in a competitive field so that they can have success as well.",0,['0']

Also on top of learning college is a place that you can network and make connections to people from different places to broaden your point of view socially and in some ways politically.

We are destined for great things if we truly believe that we are and are able to determine our own purpose. I dont think that there is some larger divine plan because that would be too perfect, and the world as we know just isnt perfect.

I also wish to give back to my parents who worked and even passed up buying a house so that my brother and I can go to college without much debt. I am here to succeed.",0,['0']
"""Why am I here?"" The obvious reason why am I here is because this class is required to take for my physics class 230. However, this lab class provides me more opportunity to understand and explores the daily life of physics. We are living in a world that involved physics and we dont even know about it. I am in this class to learn more different kinds of methods and to use appropriate method to solve complicated physics problem. I also wish to learn more about physics and to work with teammates to finish the lab experiments. With taking this class, it also helps me to understand the formula or theory that I used in my physics class. Each experiment in this class helps me to improve my knowledge in physics and physics is important because it helps us to understand our world better and even improve life by giving us technologies. This class also helps me to develop critical thinking and math skills. It brings me clarity in the mind of the basic concept of physics and helps me to understand and memorize.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? I am in Physics 232: General Physics with Calculus II Laboratory for many valid reasons. First of all, I need this class to fulfil my units because in order to be qualified for Financial Aid, I must need at least 12 units and above. Although this class is only 1 unit, it helps me reach to my requirement. Second, I also need this class as a prerequisite for my Engr 205: Electric Circuits which Im planning to take in Spring Semester. In addition, this class is also a prerequisite for my major in computer engineering. Last and most importantly, I am here to learn what physics is all about. I also want to have a chance to work closer with my classmates as a team, to make friends and to learn from each other. I hope that by the end of this semester, I will be able to absorbs most of the knowledge from the labs and lectures and the apply those knowledge in real life scenarios.",0,['0']
"The question Why am I here? is a very broad question. The way I interpret the question is either as a philosophical question or asking why I am actually in the class. To answer why I am in a physics course, it is simply because it is a prerequisite for my engineering courses. I am in Physics 230232 because I have to take this class in order to take other classes for the future. However, to answer it philosophically, I dont know why I am here. Although, I do believe that everyone has their own purpose and that life has a way of leading you to where you need to be. Maybe I am here because there is something important that I need to do with my life. This means that I cannot waste my life and have to live my life to the fullest, whether that be doing something that I love for the rest of my life or just experiencing new things and having fun in general.",0,['0']
"Why am I here Im here to learn more about physics by visually and experimenting in real life. In physics class, it could get hard to understand the concept just by lecture. This lab could provide me with visual which makes it easier to understand. Im hoping I will also be applying the concepts I learned to in real life examples. In lab, we do many experiments which involves real life examples and scenarios which can explain how things works around us. Additionally, this lab is a stressfree class since we dont have midterm and final, which inspires me to come to class and learn every day. This lab involves group work, which is very helpful skills to have. Im hoping to work and interact with my group and develop my skill more.",0,['0']
"Im in this class mostly is because I need to take it as a sideclass for my physics calculus II 230, and I believe most people in the class are whether majoring in computer science or mechanical engineering. I would say these majors are considering ones of the hardest majors in universities. After I have taken the pervious physics classes, I feel now the labs are not that awful as I would expect. Theoretically, it is considered to be the supporting role for me to digest the physics concepts which I learned from 230. I also notice that not every lab is as interesting as checking instagram, but I do want to get out something which can be used whether in the long term future or the upcoming exams for physics. And these could probably tell why Im (enroll) in this class, its to prepare my future self.",0,['0']

I am in San Francisco in classes in order to achieve higher education and to succeed later in life. I want to be able to have options, and being educated in a useful skill like computer science makes that much easier to achieve. Being in this physics lab reminds me that school is a grind, and you have to keep going in order to be successful. If you dont have the persistence to keep going, someone else is going to take your spot, and get a leg up on you. Coming to this physics lab keeps me on my toes, and I never know what to expect when I show up, but its usually a virtual lab.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? I am here in this electricity and magnetism class and lab because it is part of my graduation requirements. Although that is why I am taking the class, I have great interest in learning physics, and would take modern physics if I had the opportunity. I think learning and understanding how the world works is important; we all have some innate desire to know the origins of our existence, and physics is a means to that end. There may be times when a theory doesnt work out but thats okay because science is a lot of failure and few successes. I think electricity and magnetism is often overlooked even in todays technological age because its on such a small scale, and I think its amazing how we are able to utilize something we cannot directly touch and see.",0,['0']
"Physics Why Am I Here? I am here to learn about physics in depth and observe the principles we learn in everyday classes and practice the logic behind the essential physics concepts. I feel like the physics is at the center of life whatever we do, whether if its driving, walking or even when I am writing this essay. I am here to understand the use of the physics and get better the apply these concepts in computer engineering, like electricity, magnetivity and other principles to make computers work and efficiently learn these topics. Despite, all these concepts that is definitely interesting, I feel physics can be sometimes hard to be understood with all the details and mind boggling questions it includes. Yet, these concepts will be an important part of my work I will be doing in the future. Thus, I am here to learn physics and more to get better. Why Am I Here?",0,['0']
"Honestly, Im really confused about this question because Im not sure if its asking with a philosophical tone or asking why am I here in the class, but I will assume the first. No one really knows why were here or why were living on this planet or in this universe; to me, the fact that there are no correct answers or no true meaning, we as a species give meaning so that theres a purpose to the things we do. We have values in things like accomplishments and materials. And I dont know why I am here, being born into this life,in this state, country etc. Was it just by chance that I was born with more privileges than others? Is my fate designated to this life? I could be born in a different country and ask the same thing. And in all honesty, Im just seeing where everything takes me, because I dont know why Im here, so I might as well go where the wind takes me and to my best in how I want to live my life.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? Im here right now because I need to be here. People around the clock trying to decide what aspects of their lives involve only needs or wants. In my case, being part of a university has never been a want but a need since I started studying. Is not that I hate studying, but the fact that I dont love it makes it even harder to comprehend why am I here. The reason I study lies in the constant fear of failure I acknowledge in myself. Must people study to get money, fame, or a stable life, and to be real with you, studying is nothing more to me that a goal I need to achieve to make a person happy, myself. I need to be someone, not someone famous perhaps, but someone who can look into a mirror and recognise who is on the other side. A degree will make me advance towards what I need to be, and studying is just a medium. That is why Im here.",0,['0']
"I am here because it is a class that is required for my major. I don't resent physics per say, I was just never very good at it when I take a look at my past experiences in academia. It is not like I don't have any interest at all either, I know how physics is quintessential to basically how our entire world works and understanding physics gives us a key to a better understanding of the world. I do have a bit of interest into how planets behave and general astronomy interests that sort of fall into the category of physics. There are a lot of concepts in physics that interest me a lot like how atoms behave and how charges work. I think I will enjoy this semester a lot more due to the fact that theres more of an appeal to me. The fact that we cant see these forces at work adds a bit to the mystery and excitement of this material. While it is required of me to take this class, I very much do look forward to learning about the type of physics we cant see much of and learning how this is applicable to everyday life.",0,['0']
"I am here taking Physics 230 because my experiences in Physics 220 last semester were satisfactory and I find some interest in the subject, even if said interest isn't too much. There are many parallels that can be drawn between Physics and my choice of major (math with a concentration in teaching), specifically the numerics involved, but in my time taking Physics I've discovered that the math involved in Physics takes a different, more complex form than in Calculus despite using Calculus concepts. This has raised some interest within me as to how the math is applied differently, not to mention the topics covered in the class in general. Physics is a class that often can have a negative stigma surrounding it, especially given how abstract the concepts can get, but I am nonetheless interested in the content and try to keep an open mind as I study it.As for college in general, I am here because I wish to gather the knowledge and experience to become a math teacher, in addition to forming valuable connections with the people I meet along the way. Gaining perspective and insight from my professors on how they organize their class and how they interact with students has and will prove to be valuable in contributing to my future.",0,['0']
"Honestly, Im not too sure. Physics is an interesting topic and I do enjoy it but Im primary here given its a required for my major of comp sci. which im majoring in just because its a job I know I can do well in and tolerate as a career. If I had the choice, I wouldnt be taking it given physics 2 is likely to be a net loss for my gpa given anything less than a straight A would be. And theres about zero chance Im getting that this semester. Overall, I will say Im looking forward to the class and learning the material, especially the lab portion given it should be significantly smoother then my physics 1 lab went due to different grading policies. And it certainly beats taking any kinda of lower or upper division GE in terms of interesting material. So I guess im taking the class because its interesting, gets me closer to my end goal of getting a CS degree.",0,['0']
"Why am I here?In the sense where we are talking about why am I here, right now in the lab room, I am here because I am taking a course further complete my major and hopefully graduate on time. I am also here to learn about the meaning of life and how things around us work. I am also here because I want to learn more about how things are moving the way they are or reacting to different objects they way they react. I am here in this class because of many different outcomes that came together to bring me to this class on a specific time of day. When talking about why I am here in general, then its because I choose the path to continue school and go to a four year college because I think if I work hard during school its going to pay off after graduating and getting a well paying job that I like. I am also here because I made a choice to study computer engineering and not nursing because of how impacting it was and my interest in computer since I was young.

I have a little background related to engineering based on my last job as a Student Assistant Technician at my colleges Engineering department and my experience wrenching cars. I also had a year selling electronics parts (transistors, resistors those kinda things) at a local electronics store in Costa Mesa. Therefore I can apply those experience to Physics and Engineering courses, thus make the transition from real life to classwork to be less than a hassle.",0,['0']
I am here to help secure a future that I want to have. My parents want me to have a future that is secure for me as do I. They gave me an opportunity to further my education by letting me come to college and supporting me through the journey. I want to be able to get a degree and have an impact on society some way. Either helping make roads better or building homes for people I want to make an impact in this era. I also want to be able to teach people what I know from coming here. To spread what I learned from coming to a university and teaching it to them. My parents were not able to get an education from theyre country so they decided to give it to me.

"Im here to retake the course. I hope Im able to learn more about flux and etc. I hope Im able to gain more knowledge from these labs. Its my major course for my major, so I need to pass the class. I hope labs will also let me apply on a daily basis. Im looking forward to learn more things that I have forgotten or never learned before. I am very interested in the STEM field. I really like physics but its difficult to understand. Taking this class will help me explore this field and have a better understanding of the lecture. I can practice on writing lab reports and improve it. This class can help me getting used to collaborate with other people and build up the skill.",0,['0']
"I am here because I am required to concurrently be enrolled in this lab class if I take physics 230. I am taking physics 230 because it is a prerequisite for my major. My major is computer science and learning physics is a good way to learn how to problem solve. These problem solving skills that I will develop in both the physics 230 seminar class and the lab class will be very beneficial to me and my future aspirations. Although I probably wont be needing actual physics for a future computer science job, these problem solving techniques will be very helpful in the future. I am a Computer Science major because of the high demand and job security that comes with the major. My parents also want me to major in this field for financial reasons. I chose this major so I can accomplish my goal of being able to support my parents in the future, who immigrated to America over 30 years ago, and sacrificed a lot to give me thins opportunity. I see this class as a stepping stone to build a bright future for me, my parents, and my future family. I am in physics 23206 specifically because it is the best time for me to have this lab.

"I am here because it is a prerequisite for major classes that I have to take. But I am also here because it simply is not enough to just talk about theory of physics in class. There can be a great disconnect from the things we learn in class to the real world. Even if most of the things we do in the lab hardly have real world applications, it helps up to build up the skills needed to apply rational thought to real life situations.",0,['0']
"For this course, I expect to be able to relate the theory that I learn in 230 and be able to understand it in practical terms. I am a computer science major, so besides being required to take the course, I am looking to learn about the process that this course teaches you. I understand why this is a required course, as computer science requires a lot of problem solving and critical thinking. These are also present in physics, and it is easy to see that the process carries over on to computer science. I can't say I am the biggest fan of physics, but I do enjoy solving problems so I hope to be able to understand the work I do as well as be able to apply what I learn in other areas. One thing I also enjoy about the labs are that I get to visualize things a lot easier. For me to learn a concept, I have to do something that shows me how it works. In this case, it was helpful to learn about conduction and induction last lab, because it helped give me a better idea of how things work, instead of just having to think about it.",0,['0']
"Although I do enjoy physics and find it interesting to a certain extent, I am here mainly because I want to fulfill one of my requirements for my degree, as well as one of the pre requisites for my major. My major is computer science, and my goal is to become a software engineer at an established company in the bay area, and physics is one of the classes I have to get through; it may not be that directly related to my major, but it is a requirement that I have to fulfill. I want to at least put in enough effort to pass the class. Physics applies to many aspects of life, however, so that helps somewhat in terms of having motivation to put in effort. It also helps with problem solving skills and critical thinkingtwo very important skills to have as a software engineer. While physics may not be that related to computer sciencesoftware engineering, it does help me improve with my math skills, problem solving skills, and critical thinking skills. I am not the biggest fan of labs, because I am not very good with my hands at all, but I am required to take a lab along with physics 230.",0,['0']
Why am here?I am here because I am a Civil engineering student here at San Francisco State University. Recently I have switched my major to Civil Engineering making this class my 2nd to last physics lab before I actually am done with my physics requirement. I am here to do my best and learn as much as possible. It is my 5th year here and hopefully by the end of 2021 I will have completed all my required classes for civil engineering. I am here in San Francisco because my mother was born here in the City in 1959 and has actually remained here her entire life time. Personally I think living here was way easier than it is now as rent is super high and the cost of living has drastically increased. I think my family got lucky as they bought our how when we were young right before houses began to cost a really large amount. I sometimes wonder if Ill live here forever or if I will move somewhere else. I definitely don't want to move somewhere where it is hot all the time. I think I'm here because of destiny and it is my job to figure out if my fate is here.,0,['0']
"The reason Im here taking Physics 232 is because its a prerequisite for to get my degree in Civil Engineering.

I guess those are really all my thoughts, but I hope to do to put in enough work into this class to succeed and do well.",0,['0']
"In terms of why I'm here in this laboratory class , and being forced to stretch a simple answer of why Im here because I want to Mechanical engineer and this course is in some way needed to become one, even if in the long one, may appear to have tangental useless. But who knows, i cant see the future, and simply rambling to take up pace in this text box. Simply put, I chose this class because it not only interesting but because its required to get my degree, no harsh feelings. As of why I want to become a mechanical engineer, it mostly came from my early obsessions with cars, planes , ships and mechanical machines like cranes and power tools. And as I continue to grow and mature, I began to realize that I had a reak knack for math and science. So naturley with science and math being vital in enginnering, and with mechanical engineering, being not only fairly broad, making it ""easier"" to find a decent paying job in the future, but focusing on the mechanical and physics aspects in technology and computers. So it was almost a no brainer when deciding what degree I was going to pursure in college. So long story short, I join this class in order to one day help design and build the first affortable submarine car.",0,['0']
"I dont know whether here refers to this class or this college, so I will answer both. I am here in this class to learn more about physics in a physical way rather than in pure equations and numbers. I prefer labs more than lectures since I am able to move around and not be forced to sit still while some person talks at me. I enjoy being able to see the direct correlation between what I was taught and how it affects the world that I live in. The reason why I am at this school is because I want to pursue a degree in Chemistry. As most know right now, the environment is pretty fucked. From my standpoint, humanity needs to find a way to be less wasteful with their resources. Since using less is most likely not an option, I want to learn more about how electricity is produced and how it can be made more efficiently. A large amount of CO2 is made by burning fossil fuels. If we can reduce how much we use, then how much waste we produce is also cut down. That way we can reduce the amount of pollutants that we make and hopefully our race will live past the year 2100.",0,['0']
"I am here because it is required of me in order to get a degree as an engineer. I don't actually know how much this kind of physics that we are doing is going to help me in robotics. However, given that it's about charges and eventually magneticelectrical fields around wirescoilsetc, I assume it must be at least a little important to know. I can see how some labs can be practical for my field, but at the same time I don't ever see myself using mercury lamps or similar equipment in my field of work. A vast majority of what we plan to study in this class has nothing to do with my reason for being here in general. That's as far as I know at time of writing, at least. As much as I see myself designing and developing new kinds of robotics (for satellites or fast food restaurants), I don't imagine I'll have to go through the same system of research and documentation as we do in this lab. Yes, I will have to document my work, but I won't have to propose theories and preform experiments to determine the validity of my theories. Instead, I'll draw something up with CAD and write descriptions based on what it does and why it does it. I guess that's similar to our discussion section of our lab writeups, but I digress.",0,['0']
"Why Am I here? I migrate to the USA with my brother to live a better life. I did not know what life was here, what is the environment is like, and the community we going to live with.

I am here to pursue my career of becoming an Electrical Engineering, and physics is one of the most important parts of it. Coming to San Francisco State University was not easy at all, especially the language, community, environment, and the surroundings. I am taking physics 230232 because it is one of my lowerdivision major class, this class will help me expand my learning, daily life, and especially how physics is connected to our everyday life. It here to learn new things, meet new people, and to be able to learn the culture and how is the AMERICA DREAM that a lot of people from the different country dream of. However, life is not easy to live with, and I promise to myself that I will become successful in life and to be able to pay my gratitude to my parents who supported me since I started school or since when I was born.

"I am in this class because it is required to have a laboratory for physics class which is also required for my major Civil Engineering. But despite all the requirements, I also have passion and wondered about how Physics works. It is satisfying to me how i can connect physics in to everyday life, and how equations in physics connects to the world. Another reason why i am in this class is that physics is a big factor on civil engineering. For example on physics 220 I learned a lot about gravity and how it affects physics, through that i can make a connection Between physics and engineering such that how gravity affect building structures. With that broad idea i could claim that becoming an engineer is impossible without the knowledge of physics and that is the reason why I am here in this class.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? Coincidentally, I was thinking of one of my favorite web shows while reading this question: Red vs Blue. I believe the opening question from one of the main characters from the show is You ever wonder why were here? Well, I sometimes like to wonder why Im here, but usually stop to accept the fact that I am here now. What is existence? The meaning of life? I wouldnt bother to try to explain because Ive accepted one true fact that we all can live with: Im here right now because I have to be.Why am I here right now? To take a mandatory course the university told me to in order to obtain a degree for my major. The tools and knowledge used in this course only align with a very specific subset of the entirety of my career path. This isnt an issue for me, but it does feel punishing to be here in a sense. I have to learn and master what were taught in physics to pass our incredibly difficult class with a somewhat high statistical failure rate. I do see that it is important to develop ones mind however. So why am I here? To learn because I have to, but also to learn because I want to survive and move forward with newly acquired knowledge.",0,['0']
"First of all, Im in PHYS 232 class because this is the requirement of my PHYS 230 class. As a computer engineering student, I have finished my PHYS 222 and 220 last semester.What impressed me the most was the study of error and precision. I used to think that physics experiments were just for theory verification. If I know the theory, the result and precision of the experiment would not matter to me, but these classes changed my mind a lot, It taught me that the influence of error and deviation can be big enough to let me get an experimental result contrary to the theoretical result. This semester,I hope I can learn more experimental abilities and develop good habits of doing experiments in PHYS 232. In fact, physics is not like math, many theories are based on casual discoveries and repeated experiments. And I believe that comparing with getting the predicted results after experiments, the physical spirit of daring to experiment repeatedly and strive for truth is what I admire and want to learn.",0,['0']
"Why am I here. Im here in this class because mostly importantly I need to class for my major and I need to class because it is a prerequisite for my other classes. As for the topic itself, I dont think this is a class that I would voluntarily sign up for and the reason for this is because this class is, in my opinion, the most difficult physics class in the whole physics series. But I am here so my mindset is now to take advantage of the situation that I am in and learn as much as I can. With this mindset, I am here because the topics that I will learn in this class such as electrical circuits and electric current can be very useful in the real world; understanding current and flow of electricity can enable me the skills to fix various machines throughout my house. On a more broad scale, I am here at school because I believe that education is the best solution especially if you do not know where or what you want to be or do in your life. I believe that going to college and taking various classes will allow you to figure out you strengths and weakness and with that, possibly figure out what you want to do in life.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? Well, since I was a kid I have been fascinated with the way things work. I have always been a very curious person, from breaking stuff just to see what is inside anything to disassemble and assemble things. I do not truly have an exact moment when I decided that I wanted to study physics yet, I think this is something I want to eventually do for a career. I like to learn about how things work, I think physics is one of those branches of science where you really learn the purpose of how mechanical, theoretical, and even practical scenarios meet and can potentially explain the world. Another reason I like physics relates to the reason why I decided to do physics can better relate to a quote I once heard; to truly understand beauty is to be able to understand how the smallest part like neutrons, electrons, and even the quantum world works. Is also to understand the dimensions of time, and space. To be able to look at the start and know why the universe is what it is and is continuously expanding. It is to look at a flower and understand where the colors come from etc this quote might not be exact but its pretty similar to what I remember.

Is a question so broad that no one knows what to write except that this is a prerequisite class that we have to take in order to be able to get into our future classes. Im assuming you want an answer saying that were here because we want to be? Or because we enjoy this? I think only actual physics majors would write something along those lines. Other than that, maybe someone has a genuine interest in physics. But thats not me. In my opinion, if I wanted to really understand and want to learn physics I wouldnt be taking a physics course in this day and age. Nowadays we only take classes like these to pass, not to learn.

"The reason why I am here is because my parents wants me to get a better education. I am actually a Chinese and I went to the U.S. when I was 15 years old.

That is the reason why I am at this school, then I am going to talk about why I am in this class. I am here because I have to take this class. Actually, this class comes with the PHY230 but whatever. I study physics is not because how much I like physics and how much I love to study. My only goal is to graduate on time and get a finepaid job after my graduation. You know what, physics is dispensable to me because I dont study it and use it like those scientists. And I think it is useless in our daily life. Because major is computer engineering which means I have to take this class. Otherwise, I dont think I will choose this class as a GE although I did pretty good when I was in high school.

"Physics 230 and its accompanying lab section 232 are both required courses for a Computer Science degree. Furthermore, you have to be in the 232 class while enrolled in lecture 230 or else you will be kicked out. With both of these two facts laid out, this explains why I am currently taking lab 232. For a deeper answer, I chose to major in Computer Science because I enjoy problemsolving. It seems to have employment opportunity in the future which definitely sounds safe. For a more existential answer, I have no clue and don't really care.For more on why I'm here, I actually went to Community College before transferring over to San Francisco State. I took many classes while there but did not finish the lower division physics requirements. Ironically, it's not the only lowerdivision class that I did not take for a Computer Science major; I have to enroll in a Linear Algebra class as well as another math class. That second math class was not offered at my Community College though, so I was going to take it at this institution no matter what. Other than nonprogramming classes, there still seems to be many courses that I still have to take that focus primarily on my degree.That's why I'm here.",0,['0']
"I'm interested in this class because i want to learn more about circuits. I'm a computer science major and i like to get into programming robotics so i think knowledge of circuits is useful. I have programmed a Raspberry pi and arduino but most of the actual building of the robots and circuits was through kits with directions and i didn't feel like i really understood the wiring of the robotics so i knowledge of circuits might give me better intuition of building things that aren't pre built projects with directions. I feel like with programming, i understand enough to start interesting projects i like to do but if i want to physically build something, my knowledge of circuits, electricity, and general physics limits my ability to start projects i would like to. Also, i think physics is just generally interesting and i like to know how the world works and to be able to explain everyday concepts accurately. when i was a kid, if i asked my parents had something worked, they had no idea of the physics of it and probably gave me false answers, so if i ever have a kid and heshe asks me a question about how something works, i want to make sure i'm answering it correctly for them.",0,['0']
"I am here because this class, PHYS 230 232, is a required course for me in order to take some courses and graduate from my major. For me personally, I feel that this course is not extremely importantrelated to my major and everyday life. Although I admit that every subject has some relativity to our daily lives and everything we do, I do not feel that every course is deemed to be necessary for your education. Although it is good to have broad and general knowledge in order to add more variability to our choices in life, and to understand completely about those choices we make, I feel that it should be considered more from students perspectives on the importance of the classes. So for example this class, PHYS 230 232. I feel that personally this class is not entirely necessary for computer science majors to take. In fact, for the computer science classes that do require this as a prerequisite, there is no mention nor use for PHYS 230 232, as, according to several professors, it is just a prerequisite to keep some undergraduate students from taking the course to early or other things along that line. To me, PHYS 220 was important to learn and to know about, since it teaches you about gravity, some calculus based equations that would be helpful and necessary for computer scientists, and allow students to understand how to properly form questions, solutions, and better thought processes that can translate from physicists to computer scientists. PHYS 230 232, however, is emphasized on electricity and electromagnetism, which I feel that computer scientists, who mainly focus on software, do not need to know. It should be rather an elective course for those who plan to or are interested in computer science fields that deal with that such as biotech or other fields that need this knowledge to build and code the information necessary to make the instruments work for them.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? What got me here is the fact that Im trying to fulfill a Civil Engineering Bachelor. The more I follow my curriculum, the more I understand why I am in the classes I am. A lot of this understanding comes from my professors pointing out and explaining why we are taking that course and how the different majors related to the course tie in. Although there may be some courses in my curriculum that do not relate directly to my focus of study, they are prerequisites to the classes that will have more of a direct impact to my field of study. I am not just here to fulfill my courses though, I am here to better myself in many different aspects. I hope to really acquire the skill of critical thinking that goes beyond what the naked eye can see. I often forget about what I cant see, but that could improve through the engineering courses Ill be taking in the upcoming semesters. Another aspect I hope to improve is the communicative aspect that is used in the sciences; to be able to attain the rich vocabulary and certainty that comes after much practice and dedication. Ultimately, I hope to get out as much as I can from my education in order to give back in the near future.",0,['0']
"""Why am I here"" is a very broad question. I could answer it in many different ways. I could say I am here because of the simple fact that my mother gave birth to me. It wasn't really a choice, but I am not complaining about it. I could also say that I am here (literally) because I have to be. First of all, it is mandatory and I do not want to fail. But as much as I hate to admit it, I actually like coming to school. Sometimes it gets boring and hard, but it is fun once you start to understand how it works. Or I could say that I am here because I chose to stay alive. I am here for the free samples at Costco, hot chocolate with crunchy marshmallows on a rainy day, the chika chika during family parties, and of course my baby Mushi. But maybe the reason why I am here is because I have a purpose. Maybe. I do not know what it is though, but it is a nice thought. It is not my time to die yet. I am too young. This question got me contemplating tho, like why am I here? Honestly speaking, I have no idea.",0,['0']
"Why am I here? I am here studying Mechanical Engineering to obtain the skills and knowledge required to pursue a career in Aeronautical engineering. I plan to transfer to san Jose state to pursue my childhood dream of working with airplanes. Ever since I was little if have always been fascinated with aircraft and me at first wanted to be a pilot. Unfortunatly my parents steered me away from planes and I steered toward my interests and so this is a middle ground that both I and my family are happy with. I still hope to obtain a pilot's license for recreational use but until then I will study to get a step closer to my goals. Now with that out of the way I will talk about why I am literally here right now. I regret taking a class that starts at 6 pm. My laziness and procrastination is what caused me to be here. It takes two hours to travel from home to SFSU. And on Wednesdays, my class starts at 9 am and ends at 9 pm. So I will get back home at 11 pm and have eaten, do my HW, and other miscellaneous stuff only to wake up at 7:30 am. Now that I have explained the maco and micro reasons why I am here, I find myself attempting to finish two hundred words.",0,['0']
"I am here because it is a prerequisite for my major courses. I am majoring in Computer Science. I'm not sure why I need to take this class but I enjoy the stimulation. It really works out my brain and keeps me occupied. I'm hoping its usefulness will become more apparent as I continue with my undergraduate studies, but for now, I'm just taking this class because the school says I have to. I could have chosen to take it later, maybe next semester or maybe next year, but I took AP Physics in high school so I don't want to prolong it. If I take it later, I might lose all my knowledge on the subject, whereas if I take it now, all my previous studying will be fresh in my head. Don't get me wrong. I enjoy doing these calculations as well. It's not my favorite thing to do; I prefer coding, hence my major. However, like I said, I appreciate the mental workout it gives me because my other classes (especially my GE classes) barely provide that. Thank you for reading. I hope this has reached the required word count. Additionally, I hope for a productive school year, and I hope to be mentally and physically healthy as I study and go to work.",0,['0']
"I am taking the physics 232 lab because I need to take this class to pass physics 232 which is a prerequisite for my major. Otherwise, I would have never taken this lab as it is a big chunk of my Wednesday, and my time is very valuable. I am taking eighteen units and that is really brutal especially when it is so stem heavy. Taking this class is not my choice, in fact, it is a barrier standing in my way of passing all of my classes with all As. Therefore, for the rest of this paper, I am going to plagiarize a movie synopsis to take the rest of the room. Ender's Gameis a 1985military science fictionnovel by American authorOrson Scott Card.

"I am here because I need it to move on to my other classes and hopefully in the long run become a successful engineer. I am here at SFSU because I always had family here so I have always had a connection to the city. On the other hand my fantasy football team is pretty good. Week one hit me hard but I think I will bounce back this week against Hollywood. I have Wilson at quarterback and at WR I have Adams, Jones and cooks. My weakest link is definitely my running backs but they will come around this week. I am hoping sanders comes through in the end. I am planning as of now to keep Gallup for next year. Planning ahead is always fun but I have to take it one step at a time. Anyways I have mark Andrews at tight end should be a great year for him. I really need Sony Michel to come through though with the patriots. It is either he comes through or I will trade him for someone who can. Butker is a great kicker and will score for me all season long behind Patrick mahomes. Keep looking up my friends",0,['0']
"Im not sure what the boundaries of the question is? Why am I here specifically in this class? Simply I choose this class from a list when enrolling for classes. Not real complicated. Why am I here in general? I really cant say, an act of God or just complete luck. A product of the universe but its silly to think about that. In the end it doesnt really matter. Im here because I choose to be here thats all. My life has lead me to this point why should o question that. I have regrets of course and things Id do differently but I only exist in the present. So You could say Im here due to a infinite amount of chooses made by people or Im here because the laws of the universe made me but I prefer something more simple. Im here because thats just the way it is and to say anything else I feel is a waste of time. I suppose I thinking about an abstract question isnt a complete waste. I enjoy thinking I do it most of my day just like everyone else. This is different though, most thoughts I have regard things in reality not Im the abstract. Its a nice change a pace. Ranting along without any rhyme or rhythm let my mind wander distract myself from whatever my worries for today are. Another answer to the infamous question why am I here could be Im here to answer this question. Again a simple answers. Simple things are beautiful. Complicated answers are messy and unsightly. None of these thoughts really made any sense or had a logical flow to them. Its fun to run.",0,['0']
"I am here because it's a required class. I like physics, and my major, but let's go way back. Im here because I made certain decisions in life, but also because I was put in certain positions in life. Many of the reasons I am here is priveledge...I have enough family support, geographical base, and school to be able to go to a four year University doing what I want to be doing. Its easy to take the simple fact that I am able to do what I want for granted. I am lucky I have the freedom and priveledge to be here. I could go much more in to the actions I did to get in here, but that's not really interesting. Everyone made their mistakes and their successes in life, so I try not to think too much about either one of those. I think about what I can do to be better and about the priveledge I have.

"I needed to take this course since my major requires it. It has some fundamental concepts that will further help me understand my other major courses. I am not interested in physics and sometimes it is hard for me to grasp the concepts and formulas in class. However, it on the other hand can help me understand the concepts and relate them to my everyday life. Physics can be easy for some people and it doesnt require any effort of trying to understand it, but obviously I am not one of those people. It would be wonderful if I can learn to love physics after taking his course. I would probably start to relate everything I see with the concepts and formulas I have learned and started to explain to my friends. I heard from my cousin who attended college in China said that they started taking physics class in middle school and the physics class they took at college was at a more advanced level than the one I am taking now. If it were not for my major, I would not take this course since physics has always been the course that I try to avoid.",0,['0']
"I moved to SF State 7 months ago and I blindly follow the courses that are prerequisites for my majors i.e. Bachelor Of Computer Science. I understand that Physics is an important part for computer science as many of the hardware tools include a lot about physics, circuits and many other related topics. First, I did Physics 220 which seemed a little easier in comparison to Physics 230. A lot of topics in Phys 230 are hard and a lot newer. I wished I could have enrolled in Prof. Tennants class. I really enjoyed all the classes for Phys 220 but now I feel that I am having a hard time with Phys 230. However, now I realized the importance of enrolling into the classes a little earlier. I know why I am here in Phys 230 class, it is a prerequisite for my majors but I dont really know why I enrolled so late and messed up my semester. Phys 232 seems quite interesting, seems like I am going to get electric shock by the end of the semester. Though, it is fun to actually play with charges and currents. It seems that the professors are planning to make us the new Einstein.",0,['0']

I'm not particularly good at math or science and with are my two biggest weaknesses.

"I have been learning physics for my past years in my middle school and my high school but those are required and I just took them as my daily routine. But I never thought about why I had to learn physics. Is it because I love it? But as I learned more and more time at the university, I gradually understood. Learning physics is ultimately useful. Because physics is a science, you learn more knowledge; physics is a kind of wisdom, you learn to be smarter; physics is a culture, you learn more taste. It can be said that whether a person has received systematic and good physical education during his student years will eventually directly affect the height of his life or career. For most students, learning physics is not for further study of physics tomorrow, but for helping them to correctly face and make decisions about the large number of nonphysical problems encountered in the future, thus creating a lifetime of civilization, health and quality. The foundation of a happy lifePhysics is not something that are far away from us but something that we usually run into in our life.

Eventually, I will finish all of those classes and feel satisfaction and pride that I was able to earn a degree in mechanical engineering. Then I will rejoice in my accomplishments for a short while and after that I will get a job because it is what is expected of me. I do not know if I will be okay with it then, but I imagine the right amount of money will ensure that I am. I suppose there is no real or ""good"" reason for why I am here. I simply am.

"I am here, I guess to start initially with San Francisco State because I had a change of plans in my major. Before starting my Freshman year two years ago, I was applying to schools for Architecture and for Computer Science. Since I didn't get accepted into the Architecture schools I applied for, I decided to move towards San Francisco State in order to study Computer Science. In the Fall of 2017 when I first began my studies here, I was only taking electives and Calculus I as a math class. I put a ton of work into the semester and achieved all A's, but during this period I had less of a social life. I invested more time into my social life once Spring came around. Time went by much faster because I balanced study time in the library with being out and about in the city. During the Spring, I took Physics 220, one of the more challenging courses I had taken here, in addition to Data Structures and a few other courses. The reason I bring up the chronological order of Freshman year's events is because I developed an acute fondness for Computer Science and the field of programming. I absolutely love programming, and any concept related to it, but the other required courses such as Physics were what have always troubled me. I am taking these classes not only because they're prerequisites for me to move on to my Computer Science related classes but because they are challenging for my current mindset. I find it necessary to be challenged in this way because it changes my perception. I am able to learn differently because I am challenged with unfamiliar topics that I'm not accustomed to.",0,['0']

I've enjoyed it so far, nothing has been too out of my grasp but challenging enough to make me think a little. In regards to SFSU, I thought I was here just because i wanted to get away from my hometown and move to a bigger city, but the more time I spend here the more things I find I enjoy within the campus. Last semester I took an Asian American studies class, and I enjoyed it so much I decided to get some degree in it (whether it be major or minor). If I have never game to this school I wouldn't have found the college of ethnic studies and be on the path I am now. I originally came for Journalism, but too one class and absolutely hated it. Now i'm in Comm, Asian American Studies, and Political Science classes and I feel more purposeful not only at the school but in the city.",0,['0']
Im here at San Francisco state University to further my education and major in Finance. Leaving home will make me more independent and grow as a person. I couldn't really do that if my parents were on my back supporting along the way not being able to learn my mistakes. I always wanted to experience a new environment and go from Socal to Norcal. Having a change from having the beach literally right next to you and living in a city that's an absolute bubble to a city thats filled with diversity and using transportation is a huge change for me.,0,['0']
"As a business major, I needed to complete a lab for my major. Though I am taking this class for units, I am interested in this topic and have already taken Astronomy, which I enjoyed. The constellation, different star patterns, and learning about how many stars are actually in the solar system. I am going to SF State because I enjoy the people and love the City.",0,['0']
"I am here for many of reasons. One of the reasons that I am in this class is the obvious, because it is a lower division requirement of SFSU. However, as a lab is required, I had the choice of choosing between an Astronomy lab or a Biology lab, as I took both classes last year. The reason I chose Astronomy and am here today is because I simply love the subject and find it fascinating. It never feels like work and I get excited to learn more. It was really a no brainer for me from the start, and I knew that I would be taking this class over a Biology lab. I have always been interested in space and have loved learning about the subject, but I never refined my interest until college, when I chose to take Astronomy as my physical science, which was also a no brainer for me. That class never felt like a chore to go to, and was one of my favorite, if not my favorite class I have ever taken in my college career thus far. That is why I am here today.",0,['0']
"The reason I am here is because I wanted to fulfill my GE and this class sounded interesting I guess. Why I am here at SFSU is because I felt like I would get homesick as I live in SF and I didnt want to go to a farther college. This school is pretty nice and I like it here. But I really dont know what to do after college, what I should major in, and what job I would want. Im just letting life flow and wherever it takes me is where Ill be. Its a bit stressful because Im lost. I have a expectation to do better than my sister since my parents consider her not the best per say. But I dont know if I'll live up to it. My sleep is pretty wack. Trying to sleep earlier. Applied for a job. Still waiting for the response. Started gyming again. Feels good. I'm feeling happier which is good.",0,['0']
"""Why am I Here?"" I am in San Francisco because I wanted to get out of high school a year early, and specifically, L.A., where I grew up. SF State is the only other school I got into other then Whittier because of a transcript screw up at my high school. I am in school because I seek to build a foundation of knowledge in my interests which range from English, Philosophy, and now Political Science and Astronomy. I seek a foundation in these subjects because I would love to become a teacher to do return the favor people have done for me in enlightening and opening my mind up to enjoying learning. Astronomy specifically was a big part of my childhood because my Dad had always been obsessed with the stars, space, and science as a whole specifically when it comes to astronomy, the environment, ecosystem, etc. I become passionate in learning because it all feels very applicable to almost a daily basis.",0,['0']
"This is currently my second year at San Francisco State University. I choose this school because it was close and I enjoy living in SF, other places aren't as nice and I felt I would receive the most benefit going to a school in my city. Currently I am taking this Astronomy 116 Lab for the lab credit to fulfill my general education requirements, I found my Astronomy 116 lecture to be more engaging then my Biology course. I only took Astronomy last semester and can have a difficult time remembering most of the class's work and lecture. I was not very prudent on taking notes because it was my last class of the day, this makes the labs more challenging for me due to the fact I hardly remember anything. I prefer to do written work over hands on labs such as the ones people do in Biology. I am interested in what this class has to offer.",0,['0']
I am here because it is a requirement for lower division GE. I like astronomy but mostly just learning it not in a lab though. The teachers are nice so that makes the experience better. Astronomy is fun because it has to do with space and I love learning about space. My favorite part is learning about extraterrestrial being. We dont really focus on that though. We mostly just talk about planes and stars and Universes. Its really cool what we learn about the galaxies. There are millions of galaxies and in each galaxy there are millions of stars. Stars that are very old and stars that are fairly new. Some of these stars can be dangerous for human beings as they hold a lot of toxic gases. However there are some planets that can sustain human life. If ever need be we can rest assure that scientists are actively studying these plants so that we ever must evacuate are world we have a chance to call another place our home.,0,['0']
"I'm here in San Francisco mostly because it's the furthest away from hole but more importantly there is a great ethnic studies program and an amazing Moot Team. I really want to be an immigration lawyer, especially here in the bay since South East Asians here are getting targeted by ICE. I'm here in this class because I truly hate science and at least this is kind of interesting. I like feeling tiny in this huge world. But the reason why I keep going is for my family. They gave up everything for me to be here and Im not going to mess that up. Thats why I'm here",1,"['I really want to be an immigration lawyer, especially here in the bay since South East Asians here are getting targeted by ICE.']"
"Why am I here?I am here in this Astronomy Lab course because of my interest in space, the stars, planets and constellations. Although this class is truly a general Ed required for me to graduate, I chose it because I love this subject. This subject is intriguing, but I am pursuing a degree in Apparel Merchandising. I have loved fashion my whole life and believe it was my purpose and lifelong dream to be in the industry working alongside big name designers and stylists. Since the age of ten I would watch project runway and was obsessed with the design people would make, consistently figuring out what was great about them and what I would fix. This purpose I believe is not the only one though. I believe I also will make an impact on Climate Change along with helping animals. I have also been passionate about these two things since I was about two, mostly animals. It breaks my heart to see where the World is going and everyone needs to help stop mass extinction and other terrible factors from happening. So as all over the place this whole write up was I believe I am here on this planet to live my life long dream of being part of the fashion industry, while making a positive impact environmentally. Maybe even tying those two things together.",0,['0']

If we want to look further, I am here to enjoy what life had to offer. But as we look further death is going to be upon us. In the end, I am here for nothing. I am going to die anyways, the only thing that moves most humans forward is the small things. We can look forward to ""short"" term goals and as we set them and achieve them we make new ones. But the long term goal is to die. So to answer the question why am I here, I'm here for nothing.",0,['0']
"I chose to take this class because I took ASTR 115 last semester and I felt like it would be more interesting than taking a biology lab.

"I am here taking Astronomy lab 116, at San Francisco StateUniversity because Astrology was a big part of my upbringing throughout child hood, being raised in a spirtitual home. Last year I took Astronomy 115 to understand the actual science side behind time, space, and planets. Last year, I left Astronomy still interested, and some what confused I did not receive all of the knowledge that can be translated into everyday life. I am here because I want to actually understand astronomy and better my math skills, which are lacking due to the timespan of when I last took a math class.",0,['0']
"I'm here at San Francisco State University because this is the only thing I could do. It took me a year after high school to get here, and I wasn't going to do anything else. I'm taking this class because I need the General Education requirement, and so far, this the only interesting class I have taken, and I havent even started any of my major classes yet. The lecture for Astronomy was pretty interesting, so I kindof enjoyed it. I was a little nervous about this lad class when it stared, because three were math equations to kindof scared me a little it, but its a bit better now.",0,['0']
"Why am here is a very loaded, yet very broad question. it depends on the sense in which you take it on. one could take the easy route of I'm here because it's noon on a Wednesday, which would be to take the question at face value. But if one were to take the time and think about why we are here on the global beliefspiritual scale I'm sure we'd all have varying answers. Mine is that there is no reason for us being here. That the fact we are even alive is a mystery we can never fully comprehend, none of us have an inherent purpose or reason for being, and all that we can do is fill up our time on Earth however we feel fits best, and then die. that's it. And then everyone you love, hate, or have ever known about will die too. In the grand scheme of life nothing we do matters, it will all be forgotten, and all be erased once the end of time comes. all the accomplishments mankind has ever discovered, along with all the tragedies mankind itself also created, will fall to the test of time. To me the inevitability of our downfall isn't worrisome, it's refreshing, even relaxing, knowing that our universe will return to the nothingness from whence it came. However, this doesn't mean that anything you do in your life is pointless, it's the exact opposite. knowing the world will end makes me want to live it to its fullest potential, finding what gives my life meaning and living it every day.",0,['0']
"Why am I here on Earth? I believe I am definitely here for a reason. I think the reason goes beyond me though. I believe every single person is here only to have impact on others. We as humans are all doing the same thing. People can say that each person has a different purpose in life, but we all have the one similarity of impacting others. I think I have changed the life of all my friends and family, whether it is for the better or the worse, I have had a big impact. I think every single person in my life has had an impact on me as well. I think I was put here to make my parents' lives better as well as the rest of my friends and family. People just live life and go through certain situations but every single event is due to another person's action along with your own. Why am I here at SFSU? I am here to better my life and prepare for the future. Why am I specifically in this astronomy lab? I believe the original idea was just to get my GE's and this lab sounded interesting as well as the introduction to astronomy lab. But now I think I am here to learn something important that I can use for the rest of my life. I think everything happens for a reason, so there must be something to get out of this class. I think this class can prepare me for the future as much as any other class.",0,['0']
"Well this question is kind of vague so I dont really know how to answer it. I guess fate. 3 years ago I was living on the east coast and was wanting to go to college there, but then I decided to move out to California with my mom. This was in efforts to escape the toxic environment I grew up in Virginia, like a clean slate, I wished to make a change for the positive. So I am here to accumulate knowledge so that I can hope to be successful. But not in stereotypical ways. In whole ways, I want to follow my dreams and ambitions, not just to make money, but to feel successful internally. I learned the hard way that validation should solely be deemed externally.

"Being at San Francisco State University is an opportunity to expand my learning and experience a new environment that would enable me to endure the challenges that come ahead as an adult. Moving from Los Angeles to San Francisco, I came with the hope to learn how to become independent and vouch for my needs and wants in a society where minorities like myself are constantly under attack and come from communities lacking in resources. After a year of attending SFSU, I remain here because of the need to provide my parents with the feeling of accomplishment of having me graduated from a 4 year university. I continue to remain here because of my fight to improve the educational institution and create a safer and stronger support system for future generations to come. Taking this class in particular was meant to assist me in fulfilling my general education and pushing me towards receiving my credits toward my intended areas of study.",1,"['Moving from Los Angeles to San Francisco, I came with the hope to learn how to become independent and vouch for my needs and wants in a society where minorities like myself are constantly under attack and come from communities lacking in resources.']"
"Why am I here?There's a lot of reasons as to why Im in this class and in this university. One is obviously this class is a requirement for my general education credits and also because I thought it'd be interesting to further my education on astronomy. I am in this university in order to pursue my future career and what I want to do in life. To make a living for myself. Im here because I was to pursue a career that I love which is working with kids. I am here so that I can enhance my education and earn a bachelors degree so that I can get a job that makes a good salary and that I get to do something exciting and interesting. Another reason is to why I'm here is because Im the first of my family to go to college, hence I'm trying to make them proud of what I'm trying to accomplish. It's crazy to me that I'm here in my second year already, about to start working harder and harder to get that degree.",0,['0']
"The question 'why am I here?' is a little more complex than it is. The basic question I can tell you is that this class fulfills my GE requirements and so I have to take this class. But I mean, theres always a bigger reason because I could have taken any other lab class but I went to with astronomy. I feel like astronomy has always been fun for me to learn and know more than any other type of science. In astronomy, you get to deal with space, stars, and galaxies, which is all kinds of stuff I find more fascinating than chemistry or biology. I took an astronomy class in high school and thats when I started to realize that this sort of science interested me the most. Which is what made me take the astronomy lecture in my first year of college. And it was the same reason I am now taking an astronomy lab class. I hope to get more out of this class, not for my career but for myself to know more of, for fun.",0,['0']

I'm here to push through obstacles, deal with adversity, and mold myself into what I want to be. Every step that I take comes with a purpose, and nevertheless, every step that I take backwards comes with a consequence. My job here is to move forward. As time goes by I'm starting to develop more each day whether it's from education, social, or even in a physical aspect. I hold myself accountable and know that I'm here to grow.

"Why am I here ? Thats a very good question. One of the main reasons I believe Im here is to better myself. Although you can do that outside of school, its also good to do it inside. I think growing up I was always taught that education is the way to success so Im following and believing it will bring success. I also think that all college stuff gets you prepared for the work load that is waiting for me out there. This can also help as a place where I can make connections to later be able to get into jobs or even just help each other out. Im also here for my family that have helped me in my journey of education, so the least I can do is graduate and make them proud.

"Im here taking Astronomy because I have a love for space and I am able to take it while fulfilling my general education. Ive always been enamored by the stars as a kid. It sounds strange but the reason I even became interested in space was because of rocks and minerals. When I was younger, I was told to pick out a book to read from the library. I had never been to the library nor had I ever been able to pick something that I wanted to read. There were so many books to choose from that I just couldnt bring myself to pick one. So, I asked the librarian what I should read. As a joke, she told me to go read some of the books about rocks, minerals, and gemstones and that was exactly what I did! I ended up reading all the books they had on rocks and I didnt know what to read next. So I did the same thing and asked the librarian for a suggestion. I told how I really liked the books about rocks and how I already read all of them. After thinking for awhile, she told me to read the books on planets because they were, kind of similar. Listening to her instructions, I began to read about Jupiter,Mars, and Saturn. I became extremely fascinated in the sizes of these planets and what they were made of. Ever since then really I have been interested in space. So if I had to answer the question, I would say Im here largely in part because of that librarian but also because of my interests in rocks and minerals as well.",0,['0']
I knew I needed to fulfill my GE for science and out of all the ones offered astronomy seemed to interest me the most. I have always been curious about the stars and universe. Growing up I would go to Yosemite a lot and we would always star gaze. When people made comments while looking at the night sky. I was curious about planets and constellations. It made us feel so insignificant compared to what endless possibilities are outside our planet. Thinking about how we are only floating in space with who knows who else out there has always been in the back of my mind. To have a better understanding of this I am glad Im given the opportunity to learn more about astronomy. It is so interesting how much makes up our entire universe and how much we dont know about yet. It is always changing and we are always discovering new things. Our planet and its health (global warming) impacts us all and we have to better ourselves to keep our planet healthy.,0,['0']
"I already took the regular astronomy class, and during that class the teacher asked us to break off into pairs and discuss this same question. The guy I was next to said he was there because he thought the stars and planets were cool and wanted to learn about them. I said I was there to cover the GE. He gave me a borderline disgusted look and asked, ""so.. you don't think its cool at all? Like you're not even a little bit interested in this?"". I responded, ""um... Not really."" He turned away and never spoke to me again. I have felt pretty bad about that for ages, so when it cake time to choose a lab, I figured I could try to redeem myself.",0,['0']

Other times Im so grateful to have made a big step and change attending SFSU, I've changed so much and so has my perspective slowly but surely developing with such rich information I have obtained since arriving here. Why am I here, in an astronomy lab at 12:22 on this breezy Wednesday afternoon? Well because I thought it would be easier to take both astronomy lecture and lab simultaneously. I feel like it helps me review and get a better grasp on what I need to know in order to pass the class. No other science caught my attention as much as astronomy has. It's a big beautiful world and universe. We know some and we don't know a lot which is quite interesting, in biology we know a lot as well as anatomy but what about the universe? Now that's something scientists are still uncovering everyday and I think it's really neat to be able to see these discoveries which raise even further questions at times. Why am I here?

"I am here at San Francisco State University because I have been working my entire educational life to attend college. I chose to go to this school because I felt it was the best fit school for me since it was far enough away from home but at the same time still close enough to where I can go back and visit often. Also, I chose to go to SF State because I have family that lives in the nearby area of Daly City. So, I always feel the presence of being at home and someone to be there for me while I am away at school. I am also here in this class because I need to fulfill my GE requirement. I chose to take astronomy and astronomy lab because it interested be the most out of all the other science classes offered for my GE requirement. Even though this class has no relation to my major which is Business Finance, I do find this class to be informative and helpful. I am gathering knowledge on topics I never gave much thought to.

"I am taking the ASTR 116 course mainly because it is one of the last lower division GE requirements that I needed to complete. I did take ASTR 115 during my first semester of college last year, and having the opportunity to take a laboratory course designed for it is something that I find very unique and interesting. Even though I am a secondyear Political Science major here in SFSU, learning about astronomy for a Barea requirement has been very intriguing for me. Even though my major does not really correlate with this particular course, I still feel that expanding my knowledge in different areas of education is definitely one or the enriching ways to have a full college experience. In terms of the course so far, it can be challenging. However, being able to attend the labs every Wednesday has helped sharpen my understanding about astronomy and, in ways, has cultivated my attentiveness about our world and everything outside of it that expands to space.",0,['0']
"I'm taking astronomy because I realized animal diversity didn't have a lab. I am a little interested in astronomy so I thought I'd give it a try. Turns out I'm not as interested and my last lab teacher did not make the class interesting nor was he helpful when I was struggling to understand certain things. So then I thought I could take textiles lab and that it would count for my GE requirements. Turns out that, that class also did not count for my lower division GEs so here I am taking astronomy lab. Luckily, the lab professor I have currently is very helpful and I don't mind staying later to get help and understand things from her. I'm thankful that I don't need to stress so much for not understanding the materials or stressing about not getting help.

That dream job being a sports agent which, will then allow me to start my career and ultimately starting my next chapter in life. Being here has a profound effect on how my future is or could be. I am here in this astronomy lab because this is a stepping stone in the process of my main reason for being here. Although this class is a General Education requirement the moon, stars, and space have always piqued my curiosity despite my lack of knowledge of the subject.

"I am here to complete my lab requirements but I specifically chose this lab out of all the rest because I am majoring in astronomy so i have some background knowledge to some of the materials. In addition to this I took the astronomy class two semesters ago and I really enjoyed learning about the new things that are space related so I wanted to take the lab to expand my knowledge even further. Another reason why I took this class if I am being honest is because since this class deals with my major, I know some things about astronomy so i thought it would be the easiest lab class to take. The last reason why I am here is because I am debating on if I should switch my major or not so i wanted to take the lab and see if this is the direction I want to take.",0,['0']
"I am here in this class simply because it is a general education requirement. I do not plan to major or pursue the study of astronomy, but selected this lab because I took the astronomy intro class my freshman year with Chris McCarthy. While the subject is very interesting, I do not have a passion for science at all. My major is Cinematic arts and I plan to minor in animation in order to pursue my career goals in the creation of childrens animated films. I did not plan on attending SFSU because of the cost of living, but I ended up coming because it was the only university of 3 to accept me due to the fact that SDSU and CSUSM have become extremely competitive to get into for local students over the recent years. That being, I and extremely happy to be here and have grown to the city as much as my home city San Diego in which I was born and raised. While the city definitely has its flaws, choosing to move here instead of staying at home to attend community college has been the best decision I have ever made.",0,['0']
"I am here because this is the only lab class that would fit into my schedule and is not on a Friday. I am a student athlete and I also work so this class being once a week and on a Wednesday was super convenient for me. I also took astronomy 115 last semester and received a decent grade on it so I thought this class wouldn't be too bad. I am excited to go to the planetarium by myself and look at the stars. Having severe anxiety, I learned this is one thing that can calm me down. Also when I signed up for astronomy I thought we would be learning a little bit about our horoscope signs but we did not but I still found the class interesting. It is cool to know the different phases of the moon and how to easily find the stars in the sky. I like to work on the labs together with my lab partners, it makes things a little bit easier.",0,['0']
"The reason I am here at SF state was, at first, confusing. At first, I thought that I was here because I had to be here. Not because I wanted too. But as the school year went on, I discovered things about college and about myself and thought, maybe theres more to just going to class and taking naps. That was my thinking for the first semester of my freshmen year here at SF state. The second semester was very laid back, and not in a good way. I took classes that were relatively easy but still managed to get a D and one C. You would think that if your classes are easy, you would ace all of them right? No, the second semester I did not have a realistic grip on what my responsibilities were at school, and out of school ( work, money, household chores, friends, girlfriend ) and how to put them all together. So with the personal pressures and college pressures mixed together, I found myself swamped and less motivated to get through the school year. Cut to the current day, my sophomore year standing, I was able to step back and see the bigger picture. I was able to see that not only am I here in college to make money, but also to establish myself as an adult. I needed, and I stress needed, to learn how to manage my time, personal time, and find my motivation to get through these school days and finish this degree. My motivation includes money, family and specifically my mother. For money, I just think to myself Im not gonna miss any class because I am paying damn near 3500 dollars for this.' For my family, I always think ' I AM going to make enough money to support them.' Lastly for my mother, I think 'I AM going to make her proud.' Considering all of these reasons.

At first I took this class only to fulfill my general education, but I am seeming to enjoy this class. It is so intriguing to learn about something greater than myself. There are whole other worlds out there and I feel so small just on this one. It is also really humbling to learn about outer space. We see humans destruction of the planet and how useless humans are in this grand universe. The amount of money, houses, beauty one has cannot compare to the stars in the sky. Everything is so material and tiny on earth, and we need to remind ourselves we are not the only one. Humans are not properly taking care of this earth and that needs to be changed. We are here for a purpose and to live with the earth and not to take the earth for profit. Imagine what humans could continue to do if we advance our technology. Progress is hell.

Ive always found stars and galaxies to be fascinating and never understood the complexity behind them. When I was younger, my sister introduced astrology to me, and I thought that Astronomy was the exact same thing. Being in this class has taught me that theyre very different concepts. I never knew about the constellation called Ophiuchus before taking Astronomy 116. I also learned a lot more things throughout the course, such as what the Big Dipper is, where Polaris is, and even how to observe the stars at night and use a compass to see which direction Im in and what the altitude is. It was hard for me to tell which constellation I was seeing in the sky, so I hope to get more practice using the Night Sky tool in future labs.",0,['0']
"Why am I here?I am here because I need to fulfill my general requirements in order to graduate. Although I ama Finance major, I find astronomy to be a very interesting subject. I do believe there are worlds among us and perhaps other life in space. I find it fascinating to learn how the moon and the solar system actually works and how Earth orbits. Furthermore, I always had a dream to be an astronaut to see with my own eyes how Earth really looks like and how is it like in space, even though I know it is not so easy to become one. I am mainly here once a week trying to learn something new but mainly finish my general requirement. Its interesting to know how other planets are different than Earth. How we are trying to find life.",0,['0']

When I entered this class I wasnt quite sure what to expect, but Ive always had an interest toward Astronomy and figured I would enjoy it.

I almost attended a city college after graduating high school but my mom preferred me to attend school elsewhere. Im honestly glad she did, I feel as though Ive gained more confidence and Ive found that I like being independent.

Another reason I am here is because when I was young, I have always been curious about the universe: how the galaxy, universe, earth, and we(people) revolve around. I want to be able to learn and understand more about what i observe over what I see everyday in the sky or even around me. I feel that astronomy can be a way for me to expand my skills in the science field. So far, in this class I was able to understand in reading stars, constellation, etc. the current basics.",0,['0']
I am here because I want to be as educated as possible. I believe getting an education at san francisco state is unique and can benefit me in the future. Coming from southern california I wanted to go far from home but not out of the state. San Francisco State has provided me with the opportunity to get a degree in a field I believe I could not find in other places. Going into Freshman year I was unsure about what kind of degree i wanted to pursue. It took until my junior year to finally make a decision. I am here to study Race and Resistance in the Ethnic Studies department. I am passionate and educated on the subject. I am in this astronomy class to fulfill a lower division requirement. I do value the importance of math and sciene but understanding it is much more difficult. I hope to graduate with my degree and run for public office. If I choose not to run for public office I may decide to do the paralegal program at state. Astronomy is also interesting.,0,['0']

Once i realized this, i felt like i had no idea what i wanted to do, i still feel like i dont but i have a bit of an idea. Im stuck between two career paths, research psychology and research biology but i don't know how or if i could do both. Ideally id want to do both just so i didnt have to choose but ill probably end up having to choose anyway which is stressful. Right now im majoring in biology but i havent started my major classes because i dont know if i want to switch or not so it feels like im kind of just wasting time only taking GE classes.

Im also a big fan of quantum physics as I love learning it all on my own. Its interesting how deep you can go to ask questions. Like, why is the sky blue? Why does it have clouds? Which molecules are present in the sky? Is it made out of the same atoms, molecules, and particles that asteroids are made out of? That Mars is made out of? The list just keeps going and I understand that there should never be a perfect solution to everything.

However, SF is really different from LA so there have been many times where I have contemplated going back to LA and transferring to a community college but I look back and think that Im already here.

I had a hard time understanding this material when I was a sophomore in high school and I think the stress and hesitation to take this class stemmed off of my negative experience in high school. However, so far I have been able to understand the material better. It is still difficult for me to process all the different formulas and calculations but because I have some knowledge about it, I can understand it more clearly.If this class was not a requirement for my major, I don't think I would have taken this course.In a way though, I think that it is good thing that I am taking this course because it challenges me.",0,['0']

In addition, I am here in this specific class because it fits in best with my schedule and I am required to take it. However, as I said before, I do enjoy Physics. So in a way I did, in fact, choose to be here in this class.

I did not know how to use the equations correctly and ended up not understanding physics and ultimately failed to grasp the concept of physics and how to calculate forces, torque, and the other things in physics. Physics was very difficult to understand when I was thrown with equations that didn't work when trying to solve problems, and the only way teachers taught it is by abiding by the equations and not explaining the conceptual portion as well as they should be.

Since this was ingrained in my way of being at such a young age with my dad always working. The work ethics that my dad has passed onto me has allowed me to overcome the tough times that both work and school throw at me. Going to school full time and working over 30 hours a week without being near anyone in my family has proven difficult but I've been able to take what they have taught me to excel in what ever I put my mind to.,0,['0']
"The reason I am going to college and fully committing is because of my family. They motivate me to be a better person and to always give it my all when doing something. My parents didnt have a college education and so they want to make sure that my siblings and I get one. At first I didnt want to go to college, I just wanted to work but the fact that my mom didnt allow me to leave school made me realize how important education is to them, and how it should be for us too.",0,['0']
My family has valued hard work. Growing up I was always told that if you tried your best in any situation there would be nothing to regret. I have carried these values with me through school. Through hard work and self discipline I have been able to successfully navigate through school thus far.,0,['0']
"I have lived in the Bay Area my whole life and once rent started getting more and more expensive, my dad told me that its going to be hard to get a house when I am older. Luckily, he told me he would always be there for my brothers and I when the time to buy a house would come. My parents taught my brothers and I the values of working hard because to succeed in the Bay Area it is really expensive. This is something I plan on doing with my kids.",0,['0']
"The values of my community have made a deep and meaningful impression on me that has helped my progress through college. Being apart of a community of people that produce, whether that be writings, music, sculpting, has made me more creative and has taught me numerous extrapersonal skills.",0,['0']
Well one thing my mom has taught me is to not start something you cant finish or to finish what Ive started. This helps in getting things done. Like college in general since its taking a bit longer than Id like. Another thing is not leave something you can do today for tomorrow. Just something to get things done sooner. Its something Ive kinda slacked on a bit but not too much. Taking one thing at a time is good for me to focus and prioritize on one task at a time if I get too overwhelmed by multiple deadlines.,0,['0']
"Since I am the first one go to college in my family, my parents had sacrificed a lot to sent me to US to study, far away from the homeland. because of that I have to make a lot effort to finish my degree and get a good job after school and give them a well living life. She always told me that you had to study more so you wont get the same path as she did in the past. She had experienced a lot hardship and didnt get too much education, so its my time to finishing her dream and give her a better life in the future.",0,['0']
